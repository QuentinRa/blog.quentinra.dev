# Unity notes

This is a gathering of notes that I took for different kinds of games, such as things to keep in mind.

## Platformers

> A platformer is a game such as Super Mario Bros, in which a player is jumping/climbing between platforms, to reach a goal.

We are considering that you are in Unity 3D, without the Z-axis.

* ğŸ“˜: Add a RigidBody to the player
  * ğŸ“˜: To move the player, use forces (up=jump, left/right=move)
  * ğŸ“•: Fix the rotation (X, Y, Z) => prevent unexpected rotation
    * if you can't freeze the rotation, you can create an empty game object. Using a script, update the empty game object to match the player transform. Then, simply place the camera in the empty game object.
  * ğŸ“•: Fix the position (Z) => won't fall
  * ğŸ“•: Remove frictions => otherwise, the player can stay in the air, by clamping a block
* ğŸ“˜: you may nest the camera inside the player, to make the camera follow the player. You can tweak the Z-axis to move the camera near or far from the player.
* ğŸ“˜: to check if the player is on the ground, you can check if the player is colliding with the ground
  * ğŸ“•: if you are using OnColliderEnter/OnTriggerEnter, beware of a bug when you are both exiting and entering a new block

## Breakout

> This game is called `casse-briques` in French. "In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen, and the goal is to destroy them all by repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle into them." (Wikipedia)

We are considering that you are in Unity 3D, without the Z-axis.

* ğŸ“˜: Create 3 walls (left, up, right) with a collider
* ğŸ“˜: Create a paddle (ex: flat cube) with a collider and a rigid body
  * ğŸ“•: freeze Z-axis
  * ğŸ“•: freeze rotation (X, Y, Z)
  * ğŸ“˜: move the platform by checking the position X of the mouse
    * ğŸ—’: you may use Camera.ScreenToWorldPoint
* ğŸ“˜: Create a ball (ex: sphere) with a collider and a rigid body
  * ğŸ—’: make the ball interpolate (smooth collision)
  * ğŸ“•: freeze Z-axis
  * ğŸ“˜: make the ball bounce when colliding
    * ğŸ—’: using Vector3.Reflect
  * ğŸ“˜: destroy the ball when lost
    * ğŸ—’: check if renderer is visible
* ğŸ—’: Set the camera mode to orthographic
* ğŸ“˜: Create a brick (ex: flat cube) with a collider
  * ğŸ“˜: the brick should be destroyed after X hits
  * ğŸ—’: change color when hit, revert back after X seconds
  * ğŸ—’: add indestructible bricks
* ğŸ“˜: Create a level using bricks
* ğŸ—’: Game Manager
  * ğŸ—’: handle points
  * ğŸ—’: handle lives
  * ğŸ—’: handle levels
  * ğŸ—’: create the ball and the paddle
* ğŸ—’: add menus
  * ğŸ—’: state machine (Play, GameOver, LevelCompleted, etc.)
  * ğŸ—’: update the UI in the setter of points/lives/levels
