# Minimum (local)

[Go back](..)

If we are taking an interval [x,y], then the minimum on this interval is called `Minimum (local)` (or local optimum).

The minimum is strict if we only got one if the interval <small>(for instance, we can have two points having 0,0 the minimum for our function xxx, this minimum isn't strict)</small>.

Not tired of formulas? $x^*$ is a minimum local if we have a  $\epsilon > 0$ giving us

\[
\begin{cases}
x \in X \cap B(x*,\epsilon) \\
f(x*) \geq f(x)
\end{cases}
\]
</span>.
