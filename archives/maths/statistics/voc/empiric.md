# Empiric

[Go back](../index.md#maths-recap)

Let's say you got a sample. If you are calculating the mean of the sample, we are saying that you calculated the empirical mean (`moyenne empirique`). This is because you used the values instead of the theory.

You got

* empirical moments (mean, ...)
* empirical quantiles
* order statistic (`statistiques de rang/d'ordre`)
* ...

The main idea is that you got a vector of size $n$ like $n$ observations and after the empiric estimation, you got a vector of size $1$. You may ask yourself, how much information did you lose? Because sometimes, you really lost a lot of information.
