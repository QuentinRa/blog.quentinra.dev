# Titles

[Go back](../index.md#search-engine-optimization-seo)

You should use a long title describing your pages, and use one **h1** and many **h2**. A good title may look like this

```html
<title>MainTopic - title1, title2, title3</title>
```

or 

```html
<title>MainTopic - title1, title2 | Organization</title>
```

Notes

* You must use exactly one header "h1" (not 0, not more).
* Title's length should be between 55-65 characters
