# forbidden usernames

[Go back](../index.md#security)

You should create a list of forbidden usernames, at least to prevent scamming or phishing (even though I don't think there are many people still being scammed by that, **prevention is better than cure**).

"root", "bin", "adm", "operator", "admin", "administrator", "bureaucrat", "steward", "checkuser", "oversight", "sysop", "bot", etc.

It may be interesting to read [Wikipedia username policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Username_policy#Inappropriate_usernames) (as some keywords are coming from here). You may look for other **username policies** on the web.
