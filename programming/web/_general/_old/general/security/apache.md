# Secure Apache Server

[Go back](../index.md#security)

This page's purpose is to list notes that can't be put into a topic-specific page such as SSL, or headers. I learned a lot from [this article about apache-security-tips by tecmint](https://www.tecmint.com/apache-security-tips/). Note that you can "generate" a secure configuration [using the Mozilla Generator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=apache) and you may check [these configurations](https://syslink.pl/cipherlist/).
