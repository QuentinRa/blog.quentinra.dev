# Web programming

* You can set up a [(virtual) local server](../../apache/wamp.md)


Performance and best practices

* [Content delivery network (CDN)](cdn.md): they are making your website faster (because they are faster than loading local resources)
* you may use images .webp images instead of PNG/JPG
* [imagekit.io](https://imagekit.io/): proposing services to handle your images (optimization, etc.) for free up to 20Gb of bandwidth/month (not tested üò∂)
* I'm not too familiar with this, but this article about [HTTP Cache](https://web.dev/http-cache/) is good

* [Structured Data](structured.md): give information about the content of your website
