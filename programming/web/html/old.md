# Learn HTML5

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>title of your website</title>
</head>
```

The tags main, header, footer, section, etc. introduced in HTML5 are simply named divs. A div is a container, allowing you to group tags. This makes the code more readable, and later, it may help if you want to apply a style to a group of components.

Note that a div is "invisible", meaning that the user won't see any difference between the code with or without a div.

```html
<div>
    <h3>a title here</h3>
    <p>
      We got a paragraph that is a bit longer than usual (ðŸ¤¨)
      with one <span>span</span> inside.
    </p>
</div>
```

```html
<!-- 
 Force a space, or write a character using UTF8 codes
 Note that you will rarely (never?) need that
 -->
&nbsp; (space) &#244; (Ã´) &#224; (Ã ) &lt; (<) &gt; (>)
