> Kotlin is recommended over Java by Google since 2019.

Android Studio <small>(Google)</small> is the IDE you will use. It's based on IntelliJ Community <small>(JetBrains)</small> üòé‚ù§Ô∏è. It's quite complex with a lot of Windows.

* <kbd>CTRL+SPACE</kbd>: manually trigger autocompletion (then use <kbd>TAB</kbd>)
* <kbd>SHIFT+SHIFT</kbd>: search for a method/class/...
* <kbd>ALT+ENTER</kbd>/**hover** something highlight in red, yellow, grey... to see quick fixes/details.

#### Gradle

In the Project tab, at the bottom, you got a section "Gradle Scripts". You will have to edit the second `build.gradle` (Module: XXX).

<div class="text-center">

![gradle](_images/gradle.png)
</div>

This is inside the `dependencies {}` that you will add new libraries. You need to click on "sync" each time you add a new dependency.

#### Device Emulator

The device emulator allow you to create a virtual device or connect yours. You may (or most likely will) use

<div class="row mx-0"><div class="col-9">

* **Device File Explorer**: device's file system
* **Layout Inspector**: running app layout
* **App inspection**: to see workers/tasks/...
* **Logcat**: to see logged messages

**Note**: you may have to refresh the virtual file system manually if you don't see recent changes.

**Note (2)**: on virtual devices, use "..." to manually change settings (location...).
