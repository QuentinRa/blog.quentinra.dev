# Android development

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

You can develop Android apps with many frameworks such as React Native or Electron which uses JavaScript/HTML. This course is about **Android development in Kotlin** while you could use Java too.

> Google recommends using Kotlin over Java since 2019.

Android Studio <small>(Google)</small> is the IDE you will use. It's based on IntelliJ Community <small>(JetBrains)</small> üòé‚ù§Ô∏è. There are a few life-saving shortcuts

* <kbd>CTRL+P</kbd>: in `method(<here>)`, show the arguments of a method
* <kbd>CTRL+SPACE</kbd>: manually trigger autocompletion <small>(then use <kbd>TAB</kbd>)</small>
* <kbd>SHIFT+SHIFT</kbd>: search for a method/class/...
* <kbd>ALT+ENTER</kbd>/**hover something** highlighted in red, yellow, grey... to see quick fixes/details.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Configure in-editor documentation</summary>

To see the documentation of a method, use <kbd>CTRL+Q</kbd> or hover a method. By default, you won't see anything interesting.

* Navigate to the source of any Android class. As a remainder, you can use <kbd>CTRL+(MOUSE LEFT)</kbd> like in VSCode/...
* Click on "Download sources"
* Done

## üì± Android Studio üì±

*You should refer to IntelliJ notes if you want to master Android Studio.*

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Gradle

In the Project tab, at the bottom, you got a section "Gradle Scripts". You will have to edit the second `build.gradle (Module: XXX)`.

<div class="text-center">

![gradle](_images/gradle.png)
</div>

Inside `dependencies {}`, you will add new libraries. You need to click on "sync" (when prompted) each time you add a new dependency.

<br>

#### app/manifests/AndroidManifest.xml

This is a file that describes

* What is the main activity <small>(~=screen)</small>?
* What activities <small>(~=screens)</small> you defined?
* What are the permissions that your application needs?
* If your application defining services <small>(~=tasks)</small>?
* ...

<br>

#### app/java/com.xxx.yyy

This is where your classes will be store.
</div><div>

#### app/res

This is where the resources of your application will be stored.

* Drawables <small>(images, icons...)</small>
* Layouts <small>(the layout of each screen)</small>
* Menu
* Values <small>(translations, colors/themes...)</small>
* XML <small>(preferences...)</small>

<br>

#### Device Emulator

The device emulator allow you to create a virtual device or connect yours. You may (or most likely will) use

<div class="row mx-0"><div class="col-9">

* **Device File Explorer**: device's file system
* **Layout Inspector**: running app layout
* **App inspection**: to see workers/tasks/...
* **Logcat**: to see logged messages

**Note**: you may have to refresh the virtual file system manually if you don't see recent changes.

**Note (2)**: on virtual devices, use "..." to manually change settings (location...).

## üêõ Debugging üêõ 

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

Use the Logger instead of print/println to keep track of what your application is doing (=logs).

You must give a tag to your log. You will be able to filter messages by tag in the Logcat tab.

```kotlin
// ‚ùå improper, but easier
Log.v("SOME_TAG_NAME", "message")
```

There are 5 levels of logs. You can increase/decrease the level of logs inside Logcat or by editing the log settings.

* `Log.v`: verbose
* `Log.d`: debug
* `Log.i`: info
* `Log.w`: warn
* `Log.e`: error

If the level of log is **debug**, then all below are included, meaning that only verbose logs won't be shown/logged.

</div><div>

```kotlin
// ‚úÖ proper logging
class XXX : YYY() {
    companion object {
        private const val TAG = "SOME_TAG_NAME"
    }
    
    fun xxx() {
        Log.v(TAG, "verbose message")
    }
}
```

OR, with the TAG outside, and not inside a companion object

```kotlin
// ‚úÖ proper logging
private const val TAG = "SOME_TAG_NAME"

class XXX : YYY() {    
    ...
}
```

</div></div>

## Ô∏èüöÄ Threads and Coroutines ‚òÑÔ∏è

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-3"><div>

Most android applications runs on one "main" thread usually called **UI Thread**, which is the one handling rendering the view, processing events, and so on.

To avoid blocking the Main thread for too long, resulting in an **ANR = Android Not Responding = Crash**.

You can use a [Thread](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Thread) to a run a background task

```kotlin
Thread {
    // the code here will be run
    // in another thread
}.start()
```

[Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) are doing a job, that can be halted/resumed. They will run inside a thread, and one thread will be used to run multiple coroutines.

A coroutine can be used to run **suspend** (async) functions.

```
// suspend fun = async
private suspend fun waitFiveSeconds() {
    // delay 5000 = wait 5s
    // delay is also a suspend fun
    delay(5000)
}
```

#### Life-cycle aware coroutines

[See Life-cycle aware coroutines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines)

Ex: automatically started/restarted when the application is STARTED.

```
lifecycleScope.launch {
    repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.STARTED) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

</div><div>

Each coroutine is created from a scope. 

* **GlobalScope**: as long as the app is running
* **CoroutineScope**: custom scope
* **lifecycleScope**: inside an Activity/Fragment
* **viewModelScope**: only available inside a ViewModel

And, on each, you can run one of these functions

* **launch {}**: simply run a coroutine
* **runBlocking {}**: block the running thread
* **async {}**: generate a Deferred that we can "await"

You can add a scope, for instance, **launch(SCOPE) {}**.

* **Dispatchers.Main**: use the Main Thread
* **Dispatchers.IO**: use the IO thread
* **Dispatchers.Default**: default for intensive tasks
* **Dispatchers.Unconfined**

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Ex: Inside a ViewModel</summary>

```kotlin
class XXXViewModel : ViewModel() {
    init {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            waitFiveSeconds()
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Ex: Inside an Activity/Fragment</summary>

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        lifecycleScope.launch {
            waitFiveSeconds()
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Ex: Using CoroutineScope</summary>

```kotlin
CoroutineScope(Job()).launch {
    // ...
}
```
</details>

#### Repeat a task every XXX seconds

See also life-cycle aware coroutines.

```kotlin
while (true) {
    // your task here
    // wait, and loop again in 60 seconds
    delay(60000)
}
```

Random

A [flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) ([and](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#lifecycle-aware).) is canceled when the app goes to background/rotating the screen. We could patch that by giving a timeout to "asLiveData", but by doing that, the flow will continue to be run while the app is in the background, until the timeout that is.

```kotlin
// implementation "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-livedata-ktx:2.5.1"
val myLiveData : LiveData<Int> = flow {
    while (true) {
        val data : Int = 0 /* fetch from the api some data */
        emit(data) // send
        delay(60000) // wait 60 seconds
    }
}.asLiveData()
```

```kotlin
val preferences: SharedPreferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this)
if (preferences.getBoolean("key", false)) {}
```

```gradle
implementation 'androidx.leanback:leanback:1.0.0'
```
