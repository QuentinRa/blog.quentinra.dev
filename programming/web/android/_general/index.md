#### Gradle

In the Project tab, at the bottom, you got a section "Gradle Scripts". You will have to edit the second `build.gradle` (Module: XXX).

<div class="text-center">

![gradle](_images/gradle.png)
</div>

This is inside the `dependencies {}` that you will add new libraries. You need to click on "sync" each time you add a new dependency.

#### Device Emulator

The device emulator allow you to create a virtual device or connect yours. You may (or most likely will) use

<div class="row mx-0"><div class="col-9">

* **Device File Explorer**: device's file system
* **Layout Inspector**: running app layout
* **App inspection**: to see workers/tasks/...
* **Logcat**: to see logged messages

**Note**: you may have to refresh the virtual file system manually if you don't see recent changes.

**Note (2)**: on virtual devices, use "..." to manually change settings (location...).
