## Making API requests

Let's says you got an API and you need to make requests. You could write some code in your language (like JavaScript, Go, PHP, Python, ...) like

* creating/using some code to handle HTTP/HTTPS requests
* then making the requests to the API
* wait for the result
* then process the result

But since a lot of people may have been using the API, you should look if there are drivers available like a query on DuckDuckGo/Google/... "Github API PHP" gave my [this driver](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api).

But you may also use tools if you want to test the requests before actually starting to code. The most famous tool is

* [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/)
* but I'm using [Jetbrains Requests tools](jetbrains.md)

## Documentation

You may use these to document your API.

* [apiary](https://apiary.io/) (reader can test your API from the documentation, can be linked with github)
* [stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)
