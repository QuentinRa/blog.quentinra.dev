Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are used to allow access to internal services such as a database to both internal and external entities, but with a layer of abstraction called "interface".

For the client of the API

* üíê Easier to use the company services <small>(ex: payment APIs)</small>
* üçπ The service is maintained by the provider <small>(less work to do)</small>

For the API provider

* ‚ú® Once created, you can use it with websites, mobile apps...
* üçπ Centralize database accesses <small>(easier to find/patch bugs/...)</small>
* üíé Can aggregate multiple data sources <small>(i.g. multiple databases...)</small>

## OpenAPI

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) is a wonderful project to create API. You will define a specification, and you will be able to generate the node in many language from the specification. 

Many API specifications are available [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search).

Base template for a OAS3 <small>(OpenAPI Specification Version 3)</small> in YAML

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: API NAME
  description: >
    API DESCRIPTION. You can use Markdown.
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: 'http://localhost:3000'
paths:
  # Add your paths here
```

#### Generate server-side code

To generate a server from a specification, you can use [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) (14.3k ‚≠ê). See [Install](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation).

```
# ex: generate nodejs-express-server inside gen from xxx.yaml
$ java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g nodejs-express-server -i xxx.yaml -o gen
```

> In **PHPStorm**, everything is already set up for you, you even got schema verification. See [OpenAPI](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/openapi.html).

#### Write your YAML

‚ú® Refer heavily to [About](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) and [Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).

**Paths** are the paths of your APIs, with their HTTP methods, parameters, headers, cookies, and responses.

```yaml
paths:
  /some/route:
    get: # post, put, patch, delete
      summary: A name
      description: An optional description
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A description of the response
          content:
            # optional example of a response
        # you can add other codes
        '404': { description: "some description" }
```

</div><div>

##### Schema and Content

You will have two attributes that are coming back often: **schema** and **content**. A schema is the structure of something <small>(properties, types)</small>. In other languages, it's like defining a class. A content englobes content-types <small>(ex: json)</small> with their associated schema <small>(ex: PersonJSON)</small>.

Here we are defining that if the user requests a JSON, we return an Array of Strings.

```yaml
content:
  application/json: # could be XML... see supported formats.
    schema:
      type: array
      items: # the type of one item, this is a schema
        - type: string
      example: # optional example
        [ "toto", "tata" ]
```

Types are `string`, `array`, `object`, `boolean`, `integer`, `number`, and `null`.

##### Defining "classes" = schemas

You can actually create "classes". Add a block "components" <small>(ex: after the block "servers:")</small>. Here, we created a class **User**.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        # description and example are optional
        username: { type: string, description: "desc", example: "toto" }
        age: { type: integer }
```

You can use the reference as follows for a list of User.

```yaml
content:
  application/json:
    schema:
      type: array
      items:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
```
