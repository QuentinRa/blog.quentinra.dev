Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are used to allow access to internal services such as a database to both internal and external entities, but with a layer of abstraction called "interface".

For the client of the API

* 💐 Easier to use the company services <small>(ex: payment APIs)</small>
* 🍹 The service is maintained by the provider <small>(less work to do)</small>

For the API provider

* ✨ Once created, you can use it with websites, mobile apps...
* 🍹 Centralize database accesses <small>(easier to find/patch bugs/...)</small>
* 💎 Can aggregate multiple data sources <small>(i.g. multiple databases...)</small>
