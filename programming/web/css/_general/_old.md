# Cascading Style Sheets

<hr class="sl">

## CSS properties

The format is 

<pre><code class="language-css"
>selectors {
    property_name: property_value;
}</code></pre>

Notes

* write one per line üëç
* the `;` (semicolon) is optional, but add it üëç
* you may add `!important` to force a style ü§î
* the last style is applied ("*cascade*" üëà), or the last with important
  * to be accurate, each selector have a **specificity**, which is used to determine what property is the most relevant ([source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity))
* you may use the value `inherit` to inherit the value of the parent

Usually, when you are learning CSS, you will go to other websites that you like, and learn by reading how they do something. You can also ask something on Stack Overflow, or you check websites such as W3Schools/YouTube (**don't copy-paste code, usually websites are under copyright**). I think that the best way to learn CSS, is to learn the syntax, then look on the WEB each time you need something new, and learn bit by bit, as there are **too many properties**.

## Responsive design

This is most likely what will take most of your time, and why I switched to Bootstrap. Your user will use different resolutions when visiting your website, different browsers, and different platforms (mobile, tablet, computer, etc.). This is your job, that the website is properly rendered on each platform, and that's a practice called **responsive design**.

The first thing to do is to add this line in your HTML, so that the website will try to adapt itself according to the size of the screen

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Then, we will write **media queries**. These are blocks in which you will declare the rules that should be used if the screen is lesser than "Xpx" or greater than "Ypx" or within "Xpx" and "Ypx".

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 950px) {
    /* the style declared here will only
     be used is the width is lesser than
     950px. */
}

@media screen and (max-width: 1100px) and (min-width: 950px) {
    /* ... */
}
```

You can use that to hide/show some buttons, change some component's positions, ...

> **edit 02/09/2021**: media queries are more complex than what I learned, you can [read more here](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/media-css#media-types), as I saw a lot of times `@media (min-width: 950px) {}` instead of the code above with `screen and`.

## Animations

I never used CSS animations (hence you may complete this part), but here are some links. It looks fun, and I hope someone will scout this for us

* [MDN - CSS animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations)
* [CSS-tricks - Animation Libraries](https://css-tricks.com/css-animation-libraries/)

## SCSS, SASS, and Less

You can use Less, SASS, or SCSS to write a sort of enhanced CSS. Both are similar, but the syntax is a bit different. You may read [JetBrains tutorial to configure watchers too (in PHPStorm)](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/transpiling-sass-less-and-scss-to-css.html#ws_sass_less_scss_syntax_highlighting) (you can enable/disable watchers).

```bash
npm install sass -g 
# watcher
sass --watch input.scss output.css
# or compile when you want
sass input.scss output.css
```

As always, [W3Schools got a tutorial about SASS](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/default.php). [SASS official documentation](https://sass-lang.com/guide) is quite good too.

<tr>
<td><b>Breaking into files</b></td>
<td>You can split a SCSS into files=modules, the modules are starting with a <code>_module.scss</code>. Then, in the main file, use

<pre class="language-scss"><code>@import 'module'</code></pre> (or @use)
</td>
