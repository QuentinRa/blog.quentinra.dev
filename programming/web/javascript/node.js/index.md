[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a modern JavaScript environment that can be used

* üóÉÔ∏è To write websites <small>(express handlebars...)</small>
* üì¶ To write desktop/mobile apps <small>(electron...)</small>
* üçπ To create APIs <small>(express...)</small>
* üî•Ô∏è To write Typescript <small>(a typed JavaScript)</small>
* ‚ú® To write LESS/SASS/Stylus/... <small>(improved CSS)</small>
* ... and many more

‚û°Ô∏èYou can find the [documentation here](https://nodejs.org/api/) or [here](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/). [Learn here](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn).
</div><div>

You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). On Windows, you will get an installer, so you can get started in seconds. To check that you installation was successful, use

```powershell
# see Node version
$ node -v
# run a JavaScript
$ node index
$ node index.js
```

> To easily manage multiple version of Node, see [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (64k ‚≠ê), [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (25k ‚≠ê), or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) (17k ‚≠ê).

## Node.js basics

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Packages

You will usually need to use external libraries such as a library to test your code, or stuff like that. They are referred to as package, and you will need a **package manager** to install them.

#### In a nutshell

Node.js includes everything you know about JavaScript, aside from the DOM <small>(document, window...)</small> as Node.js is NOT replicating an environment similar to a web browser.
</div><div>

#### What's new?

* Import a packages with **require**

```javascript
// pre-installed, see https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html
const FileSystem = require('fs');
```

Sub-example: Access another script B from a script A

```javascript
// in A, you need to export what you want to expose
module.exports = {}
module.exports.five = 5
// in B, use require
const A = require('./A.js')
console.log(A.five)
```

## npm package manager

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[npm](https://github.com/npm/cli) (~17k ‚≠ê) is the most well-known package manager for Node.js, as it comes bundled with Node.js in most distributions.

```powershell
$ npm install -g npm
$ npm -v
```

* See the [documentation here](https://docs.npmjs.com/).
* Use [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/) to find packages.

npm use a file called `package.json` to known which packages to import in your project. As the version are usually based on a rule, the exact version of the package can be found in `package-lock.json`.

* Create an empty project with an empty `package.json`

```powershell
$ npm init
```

All installed packages are stored in the folder `node_modules`. ‚ö†Ô∏è Add it to your `.gitignore`, because it's heavy+useless. 

Instead, commit `package-lock.json`. Someone else will use the command below to install the same packages+version as yours.

‚û°Ô∏è Commit `package.json` too, so that devs can add packages...

* Install existing project (from `package-lock.json`)

```powershell
$ npm ci
```

</div><div>

* Add packages in `package.json/dependencies` and install them.

```powershell
# add in package.json/dependencies + install it
$ npm i express
$ npm install express
# generate package-lock.json from package.json
$ npm i
$ npm install
# Update package-lock.json
$ npm update
```

* Run a task: usually, we store the commands to run/... a project in `package.json/scripts`. To run "start" below, use `npm start`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    // "npm start" will run "node index.js"
    "start": "node index.js"
  }
}
```
