# System calls

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

System calls are low-level functions that are directly interacting with the Linux kernel. You would usually use them in assembly, but this will be explained in another course. Rather, this course will focus on system calls in C, as this is hopefully simpler to learn than assembly.

</div><div class="align-self-center">

They are defined in `man 2`, such as `man 2 open`. See `man 2 syscalls`.

## `perror` - print a system call's error message

*This is not a system call, but let's make one exception*.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void perror(const char *s);
```
</div><div class="align-self-center">

If a system call failed, an error code will be set. You can use `perror` to print the error message, and you can even append your own error message with the parameter `s`.
</div></div>

> **NOTE**: system calls are usually returning **0 upon success, and -1 upon failure**. If an error occurred, they set the global variable `errno` with a code indicating what error occurred. `perror` will use this code to display a human-readable error message.

<hr class="sl">

## `exit` - kill the process

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

```c
#include <unistd.h>

void exit(int status);
```
</div><div class="align-self-center">

You will use this to terminate the program.
</div></div>

<hr class="sr">

## `open` - open a file

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

```c
#include <fcntl.h>

int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
```

This function returns an `int`, usually called `fd`, short for **file descriptor**, and is used by other system calls. If you didn't know, there are 3 already open file descriptors: 

* stdin, standard input: `0`
* stdout, standard output: `1`
* stderr, standard error output: `2`
</div><div class="align-self-center">

* `pathname` is the path to your file

* `flags` are a list of one, or mode options, separated with a pipe (`|`), used to determine how the file is opened.
  * `O_RDONLY`: read only
  * `O_WRONLY`: write only
  * `O_CREAT`: create if it does not exist
  * `O_TRUNC`: truncate/clear content

* If you are creating a file, you must add a third argument, which is the permissions given to the file, such as `0600`.
</div></div>

<hr class="sl">

## `read` - read a file descriptor

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

```c
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
```

For instance, here is an example

```c
char str[11];
ssize_t res = read(0, &str, 10);
```

The system call returns `-1` upon failure (see perror), or the number of character read.
</div><div class="align-self-center">

* `fd` is the file descriptor from which you want to read

* `buf` is where you will store what you read. It's usually a char array, but it could be something else.

* `count` is the size of what you want to read.

> You will most likely enter `n` to read `n` chars, but you should note that you implicitly wrote `10 * sizeof(char)`, and as the `sizeof(char)` is `1`, then you can only write `10`.
</div></div>

<hr class="sr">

## `write` - write in a file descriptor

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

```c
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```

For instance, here is an example

```c
ssize_t res = write(1, "Hello, World", 13);
```

The system call returns `-1` upon failure (see perror), or the number of character written.
</div><div class="align-self-center">

* `fd` is the file descriptor in which you want to write

* `buf` is what you want to write. It's usually a string, but it could be something else.

* `count` is the size of what you want to write. Like read, you should use `sizeof(xxx)` if you are writing something else than chars <small>(for which sizeof is usually omitted because it's 1)</small>.
</div></div>

<hr class="sl">

## `lseek` - move through a file

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

```c
#include <unistd.h>

off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
```

Note that the function is returning your new offset in the file. To get your offset at any time, you can use this trick:

```c
... = lseek(xxx, 0L, SEEK_CUR);
```
</div><div class="align-self-center">

* `fd` is the file descriptor
* `offset` is a number (long) of character you want to skip starting from "whence"
* `whence` is the location we are moving to before applying the offset.
  * `SEEK_CUR`: do not move, use the current position
  * `SEEK_SET`: move to the start of the file, and apply offset
  * `SEEK_END`: move to the end of the file, and apply offset

If you understood right, to move back to the start, you would do

```c
... = lseek(xxx, 0L, SEEK_SET);
```
</div></div>

<hr class="sr">

## `close` - close a file descriptor

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int close(int fd);
```
</div><div class="align-self-center">

Aside from 0, 1, and 2, every file descriptor should be closed. 

* `fd`: the file descriptor you want to close
* return `0`, or `-1`
</div></div>

<hr class="sl">

## `stat` - close a file descriptor

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int stat(const char *pathname, struct stat *statbuf);
int fstat(int fd, struct stat *statbuf);
```

`stat` is taking a path to a file or a file descriptor for `fstat`, and an empty structure, and will fill it with info about the file. If the function failed to do its job, then `-1` is returned.

```c
struct stat s;
int res = stat("path", &s);
res = fstat(xxx, &s);
```

</div><div class="align-self-center">

```c
struct stat {
 dev_t     st_dev;     /* ID of device containing file */
 ino_t     st_ino;     /* inode number */
 mode_t    st_mode;    /* protection */
 nlink_t   st_nlink;   /* number of hard links */
 uid_t     st_uid;     /* user ID of owner */
 gid_t     st_gid;     /* group ID of owner */
 dev_t     st_rdev;    /* device ID (if special file) */
 off_t     st_size;    /* total size, in bytes */
 lksize_t st_blksize; /* blocksize for file system I/O */
 blkcnt_t  st_blocks;  /* number of 512B blocks allocated */
 time_t    st_atime;   /* time of last access */
 time_t    st_mtime;   /* time of last modification */
 time_t    st_ctime;   /* time of last status change */
};
```
