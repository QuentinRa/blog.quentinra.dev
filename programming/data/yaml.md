# YAML

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

YAML is way more complex than JSON. In fact, JSON syntax is included in YAML. YAML is quite human-readable ðŸš€, so in some cases, it may be better to use YAML rather than JSON.

* **List**

```yaml
# all are the same
list1:
  - a
  - b
  - c
list2: [a, b, c]
list3: ['a', 'b', 'c']
```
</div><div>

* **Keys**

```yaml
key1: value
key2: {}
key3:
  - true
  - 5
  - "toto"
```

* **Texts** (inline and multiline texts)

```yaml
inline: This is an inline text
multiline_text1: This is a really really really
  long long text. 
  And this is still part of the text ðŸš€.
multiline_text2: >
  Same.
```
</div></div>
