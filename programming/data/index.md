# YAML

YAML is way more complex than JSON. In fact, JSON syntax is included in YAML. YAML is quite human-readable ðŸš€, so in some cases, it may be better to use YAML rather than JSON.

* **List**

```yaml
- a
- b
- c

# same as
[a, b, c]
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

* **Keys**

```yaml
key1: value
key2: 5
key3: {}
key4: true
key5: ['a', 'b', 'c']
key6:
  - a
  - b
  - c
```

* **Long texts**

```yaml
short: This is a short text
long_text: This is a really really really
  long long text. 
  And this is still part of the text ðŸš€.
```
