<b>Dark mode 🐱‍👤 </b>
</h1>

I was planning to add a dark mode, but I would need a <b>cookie</b> to store if you enabled it.

I'm not planning to use cookies, so the alternative you might use is the [Dark reader extension](https://darkreader.org/). The website is rendering properly with it, and if you got a better solution, feel free to get in touch with me. If you ever see something that is unreadable with it, get in touch with me, and I will fix it. Thanks.
