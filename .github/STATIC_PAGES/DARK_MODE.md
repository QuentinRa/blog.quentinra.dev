<b>Dark mode 🐱‍👤 </b>
</h1>

Originally, no dark mode was available, as  I would need a <b>cookie</b> to store if you enabled it. But, I'm now using the CSS media query `prefers-color-scheme` to check **whether your browser is in light or in dark mode**. According to your preference, I'm showing the website either in dark or in light.

Previously, you could install an extension such as [Dark reader extension](https://darkreader.org/) to enable the dark mode, but this isn't working well now that I changed some colors (for WCAG compliance).

If you got a better solution, or you want to share your feedback, feel free to open [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/lgs-games/memorize/issues). Thanks 🚀.
