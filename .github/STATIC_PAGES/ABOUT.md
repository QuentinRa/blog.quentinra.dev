    About <b>Memorize</b>
</h1>

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div class="align-self-center">

<b>Welcome</b> üëã on the **v5** of **Memorize**.

The main goal is to easily access knowledge, tips, and experiences about something in one place. To improve the reliability of the knowledge, every course is stored in a public place, and open for edits.

* You can find [Memorize changelog here](https://github.com/lgs-games/memorize/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md).

* You can find [Memorize Roadmap here](https://github.com/lgs-games/memorize/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

I hope you'll find it to your liking - Quentin "Calistro" RA

<p class="text-center fs-4">Some history üó∫Ô∏èüìå</p>

* **02-2020**: It all started with a website called RpgDatabase, in which I tried teaching my friends that wanted to learn the lwjgl3 library, to create a [Role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game).

* **06-2020**: I tried to make a whole website with everything that I learned so far (Java, C, Probabilities, SQL, HTML/CSS/PHP...)

* **10-2020**: I wanted to help my classmates struggling in IT. I made `memorize.readthedocs.io`, this was the start of **Memorize**.

* **11-2021**: I tried to improve every course, which made quite a lot of courses leave the front üò¢

<b>Technologies</b>

I made this website in <b>PHP</b>, and the courses are data-driven

* The courses are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/lgs-games/memorize)
* They are fetched from GitHub using the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
* I'm parsing the courses with [CommonMark for PHP](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/)

As for the design,

* I'm using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the style
* I'm using [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) for the icons
* If you got hooked by the <b>beautiful backgrounds</b>, they were made by [kronbits](https://kronbits.itch.io/backgrounds)

As for the other tools.

* I'm coding in [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
* The code is highlighted by [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) or [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
* I used the [Easy Markdown Editor](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) for the editor on the edit page.
* Math equations are in latex, and they are parsed using [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
* I'm using [atomurl](http://atomurl.net/math/) to write math in Latex.
* I'm using [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/fr/) to fix a lot of my typos.
* The website is hosted by [On vous h√©berge (OVH)](https://www.ovh.com/)
