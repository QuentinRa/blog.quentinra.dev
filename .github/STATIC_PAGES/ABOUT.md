    About <b>Memorize</b>
</h1>

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div class="align-self-center">

<b>Welcome</b> üëã on the **v5** of **Memorize**.

The main goal is to easily access knowledge, tips, and experiences about something in one place. To improve the reliability of the knowledge, every course is stored in a public place, and open for edits.

* You can find [Memorize changelog here](https://github.com/lgs-games/memorize/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md).

* You can find [Memorize Roadmap here](https://github.com/lgs-games/memorize/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

I hope you'll find it to your liking - Quentin "Calistro" RA

<p class="text-center fs-4">Some history üó∫Ô∏èüìå</p>

* **02-2020**: It all started with a website called RpgDatabase, in which I tried teaching my friends that wanted to learn the lwjgl3 library, to create a [Role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game).

* **06-2020**: I tried to make a whole website with everything that I learned so far (Java, C, Probabilities, SQL, HTML/CSS/PHP...)

* **10-2020**: I wanted to help my classmates struggling in IT. I made `memorize.readthedocs.io`, this was the start of **Memorize**.

* **11-2021**: I tried to improve every course, which made quite a lot of courses leave the front üò¢
