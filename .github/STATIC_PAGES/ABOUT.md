    About <b>Memorize</b>
</h1>

I first made a website called RpgDatabase, because my friends and I wanted to make an [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game).

Later, I thought that it would be convenient if I made a website with everything that I learned, so that

* I would not have to re-open my old books to look for something
* I can read my courses everywhere

Then since November 2020, I thought of helping my classmates too, and created "Memorize". You can find [the changelog here](https://github.com/lgs-games/memorize/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md).

<b>Technologies</b>

I made this website in <b>PHP</b>, and the courses are data-driven

* The courses are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/lgs-games/memorize)
* They are fetched from GitHub using the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
* I'm parsing the courses with [CommonMark for PHP](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/)

As for the design,

* I'm using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the style
* I'm using [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) for the icons
* If you got hooked by the <b>beautiful backgrounds</b>, they were made by [kronbits](https://kronbits.itch.io/backgrounds)

As for the other tools.

* I'm coding in [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
* The code is highlighted by [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) or [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
* I used the [Easy Markdown Editor](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) for the editor on the edit page.
* Math equations are in latex, and they are parsed using [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
* I'm using [atomurl](http://atomurl.net/math/) to write math in Latex.
* I'm using [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/fr/) to fix a lot of my typos.
* The website is hosted by [On vous héberge (OVH)](https://www.ovh.com/)
