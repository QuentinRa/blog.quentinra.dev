```bash
$ sudo apt install maltego # tested on Kali Linux
$ maltego
```

Select "Maltego CE (free)", then once you [created a MaltegoCE account](https://www.maltego.com/ce-registration/), you can get started in your first investigation. Click on "new". You will see a white bord. In the left column, you can drag, and drop a starting point. For instance,

1. Search "domain"
2. Drag-and-drop it on the white board
3. Double-click on it to edit it, enter a domain name, then press "ok"
4. Right-click on it, you can now search from something related to this domain name <small>(ex: email addresses...)</small>. If you want to try to look for "everything", then run all transforms
