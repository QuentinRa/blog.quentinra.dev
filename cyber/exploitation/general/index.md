## Password attacks

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There are 3 usual ways of carrying a password attack

* **Password Guessing**: based on knowledge of the target (birth year...)
* **Dictionary Attack**: test a list in which there may be the password
* **Brute Force Attack**: try every possibility (ex: incremental ASCII)

As a hacker, if there is a policy of "at least n characters/up to $m$ characters", then it would be very wise to filter shorter/longer values from the dictionary. For instance, with `rockyou.txt`

* `{n}`: only keep values having exactly $n$ characters
* `{n,}`: only keep values having more ($\ge$) than $n$ characters
* `{n,m}`: only keep values having between $[n,m]$ characters
* `{,m}`: only keep values having less ($\le$) than $m$ characters

```bash
# only keep 4 letters passwords
$ egrep '^.{4}$' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > /tmp/4rock.lst
# which is the same as
$ grep '^....$' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > /tmp/4rock.lst
```

There are a few remediation

* Block an IP after $n$ failed attempts within $x$ seconds

* Use a strong password policy

* Delay authentication attempts (throttle) to slow down attacks

* Use a CAPTCHA while taking into account that they are services to "bypass" them

* Use two-Factor authentification
