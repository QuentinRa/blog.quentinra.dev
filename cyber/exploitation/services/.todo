Servers implementing these protocols are subject to different kinds of attacks. To name a few, consider:

* Sniffing Attack (Network Packet Capture)
  * using a network packet capture tool to collect information about the target
  * Tcpdump is a free open source command-line interface (CLI) program that has been ported to work on many operating systems.
  * Wireshark is a free open source graphical user interface (GUI) program available for several operating systems, including Linux, macOS and MS Windows.
  * Tshark is a CLI alternative to Wireshark.
  * Before explaining this command, we should mention that this attack requires access to the network traffic, for example, via a wiretap or a switch with port mirroring. Alternatively, we can access the traffic exchanged if we launch a successful Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
  * `sudo tcpdump port 110 -A` (only port 110=POP3, and ASCII)
  * Wireshark: enter "pop" > same result but nicer
  * TLS have been added to HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP
* Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
  * A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a victim (A) believes they are communicating with a legitimate destination (B) but is unknowingly communicating with an attacker (E).
  * The attacker can modify the information send by the client, or sniff packets. It depends of the integrity checks/security of the protocol.

  * The solution lies in proper authentication along with encryption or signing of the exchanged messages. With the help of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and trusted root certificates, Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects from MITM attacks.
