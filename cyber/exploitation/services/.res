Sniffing Attack (Network Packet Capture) - https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices2
=> using a network packet capture tool to collect information about the target
=> Tcpdump is a free open source command-line interface (CLI) program that has been ported to work on many operating systems.
=> Wireshark is a free open source graphical user interface (GUI) program available for several operating systems, including Linux, macOS and MS Windows.
=> Tshark is a CLI alternative to Wireshark.
=> Before explaining this command, we should mention that this attack requires access to the network traffic, for example, via a wiretap or a switch with port mirroring. Alternatively, we can access the traffic exchanged if we launch a successful Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
=> `sudo tcpdump port 110 -A` (only port 110=POP3, and ASCII)
=> Wireshark: enter "pop" > same result but nicer

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack - https://tryhackme.com/room/networkservices2
=> https://snyk.io/learn/man-in-the-middle-attack/
=> A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a victim (A) believes they are communicating with a legitimate destination
=> (B) but is unknowingly communicating with an attacker (E).
=> The attacker can modify the information send by the client, or sniff packets.
=> It depends of the integrity checks/security of the protocol.
=> https://www.ettercap-project.org/
=> https://www.bettercap.org/
=> The solution lies in proper authentication along with encryption or signing of the exchanged messages.
=> With the help of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and trusted root certificates,
=> Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects from MITM attacks.
