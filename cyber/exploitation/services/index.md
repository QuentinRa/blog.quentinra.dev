Most entries in this course are partial knowledge about protocols/services extracted from the [Protocols & Services course](/info/networking/protocols/index.md), with cybersecurity related notes about them. The former course is more about describing the services, and the client that may be used to interact with them.

[Samba](https://www.samba.org/) is making both file exchange system of Linux (NFS), and Windwos (SMB) work together. It's mostly used to share file internally, by connecting every computer, printer... to a **share**, a shared folder.

Find shares using nmap

```bash
$ nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse ip
```

* Try connecting without submitting a password

```bash
$ smbclient //IP/share_name
```
