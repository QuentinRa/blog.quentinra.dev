**Disclaimer** ‚ö†Ô∏è: I had a hard time putting content in a place I would expect them to be, hence this page will **only** cover techniques to get information about a service using the banner, while **techniques** like enumerating users/..., **knowledge**, along other in-depth stuff will be in [Exploiting Services](/cyber/exploitation/services/index.md).

## Grab banner of noisy services

This is automatically done by tools like `nmap`, along with a few more checks!

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

### üîì Telnet - 23 (tcp)

`telnet` is useful to grab the banner of noisy TCP services.

```bash
$ telnet IP 21
# you may see some FTP banner
[...] FTP server (Version 6.4/OpenBSD/Linux-ftpd-0.17) ready.
```
</div><div>

### üîì netcat - (tcp/udp)

`nc` (netcat) doing the same as `telnet`, but we can also grab banners of noisy UDP services.

```bash
$ nc IP 21
# you may see some FTP banner
[...] FTP server (Version 6.4/OpenBSD/Linux-ftpd-0.17) ready.
```
</div></div>

## Grab HTML headers

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

You should use `curl`

```bash
$ curl -I IP:port
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
# ...
```

You could use `nmap`

```bash
$ nmap --script=http-server-header.nse IP -p80,443
$ nmap -sC IP -p80,443 # may provide less information
```

> You can use your browser too, open the console, and check in the network tab.
</div><div>

You could use `telnet` for HTTP too...

```bash
$ telnet IP 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
HOST: random_value

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
# ...
```
</div></div>
