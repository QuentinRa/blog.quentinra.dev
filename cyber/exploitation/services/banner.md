**Disclaimer** ‚ö†Ô∏è: I had a hard time putting content in a place I would expect them to be, hence this page will **only** cover techniques to get information about a service using the banner, while **techniques** like enumerating users/..., **knowledge**, along other in-depth stuff will be in [Exploiting Services](/cyber/exploitation/services/index.md).

## Grab banner of noisy services

This is automatically done by tools like `nmap`, along with a few more checks!

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

### üîì Telnet - 23 (tcp)

`telnet` is useful to grab the banner of noisy TCP services.

```bash
$ telnet IP 21
# you may see some FTP banner
```
</div><div>

### üîì netcat - (tcp/udp)

`nc` (netcat) doing the same as `telnet`, but we can also grab banners of noisy UDP services.

```bash
$ nc IP 21
# you may see some FTP banner
```
