# Frameworks

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* Look if the framework is credited at the bottom of the page
* Look if there is a comment with the framework name/... in the HTML
* Look for the default favicon of the framework. Usually, it's stored at `/favicon.ico`, although it's usually removed. If you do find one, download it, hash it (MD5), and [find it in OWASP favicon database](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database)

```bash
# Linux
curl url/favicon.ico | md5sum
# Windows (on a download favicon)
Get-FileHash .\favicon.ico -Algorithm MD5
```

If you found a framework

* Look for a way to get the version (as a client, if any). For instance, the framework in a specific version, may use a specific version of a JavaScript/CSS library, if any. It may be a hint, trough it's not reliable.
* Look for common misconfiguration mistakes
* Look for vulnerabilities
* Look for the login page / CMS panel.
    * Test default credentials
    * Test bruteforce password, with the default username
