## Terminology

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A URL is a suite of: a scheme (http/https), a username, a password, `@`, a domain, `:`, a port, a route, a query (`?`), and a fragment (`#`). Most parameters are options, and URLs you will use will mostly look like this

```
http://example.com
http://example.com:80
https://example.com
https://example.com:443
https://example.com/route/?query#fragment
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1:80
[...]
```

Requests are using a method to send something to the server.

* `GET`: get a resource
* `POST`: upload a resource
* `PUT`: update ONE field of a resource
* `DELETE`: delete a resource
* ...
</div><div>

And a request has headers both set by the client, and the server, in order for each of them to send more information than just data:

* `Set-cookie`: if the server want to create a cookie
* `Host`: the server that the request is addressing
* `Server:` (opt): name of the HTTP service, its version, and even the OS
* ...

The server will answer with an [HTTP response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) according to how it could handle the request (200=OK, 301/303=redirected, 404=Not found, 500=Internal error...).

**Random**

* Web Application Firewall (WAF): protect web apps against DDOS/..., and analyse/limit-rate traffic from bots.
* Content Delivery Networks (CDN): servers that are used to store static resources of a website. When a website needs a resource, the nearest CDN server is used, allowing a faster response.
* Load Balancers: interface between clients and server, distributing the load among the available servers using algorithms such as round-robin <small>(in turn)</small>, or weighted <small>(is server busy?)</small>. There are periodic check to ensure that servers are still online, and if there is no response, a server is considered down until proven otherwise.

* XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a vulnerability that abuses features of XML parsers/data (in-band and out-of-band/blind)
  * It often allows an attacker to interact with any backend or external systems that the application itself can access and can allow the attacker to read the file on that system.
  * DoS SSRF
* Every XML document mostly starts with what is known as XML Prolog.
* <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
* XML allows validation using DTD and Schema.

  * Coookies => user can edit values from its side, can decode them...
  * Ex: flask in Python pickle.load, that can load a cookie in which the base64

* do good logging / do not display too much info about errors

* do not override an existing file. Usual practices are generating/assigning a name to the uploaded file. There could be prefixed/postfixed too. They could be checks if the name is taken.
* webshells, and reverse/bind shells. Realistically a fully featured reverse/bind shell is the ideal goal for an attacker; however, a webshell may be the only option available (for example, if a file length limit has been imposed on uploads, or if firewall rules prevent any network-based shells)
* <?=system($_GET["cmd"] ?? "whoami");?>

* filter extensions (blacklist/whitelist)
* file type (MIME validation=Content-Type=<type>/<subtype>=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types, Magic Number validation=bytes at the beginning of the file)
* file length
* file name (check not overriding protected file)
* file content
* Client-side: turn off JS, intercept (page:remove JS, file: edit), do the request manually: `curl -X POST -F "submit:<value>" -F "<file-parameter>:@<path-to-file>" <site>`
* BurpSuite intercept javascript: you need to remove `^js$` in options > intercept client requests / File extension does not match. You may have to clear the cache. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37296343/modify-javascript-with-burp-if-js-is-in-separate-file-but-gets-loaded-in-the-s
* pathinfo to get the extension, then a blacklist with a switch. We can pass it easily with values such as PhP pHP... or php5... .phtml... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP
* hexeditor to edit the hex of a file. Write X letters, save, open in hex editor, and replace them with magic number: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures
* writeups
* Inspect the client side, try using valid files, see where it lands, what's the naming scheme... Test really weird extensions, to see if blacklist or whitelist. Try the geniune file with a malicious magic number, to see what is checked.
* check the server size filter
* gobuster check the size of the element found
* whatweb url
