**Sessions cookies**

Session cookies are used to store data on the server, associated with someone visiting the website. Once the session is started server-side, a file will be created on the server with an id such as `f71dbe52628a3f83a77ab494817525c6`. The programmer can store inside stuff like

* is the user connected ?
* the user information such as the clientID...
* ...

A session is available in every page server-side, so programmers use it to adapt the page according to what we know about the user <small>(ex: not logged in $\to$ redirect to login)</small>. 

The server will send the session id in a cookie, and the client will send it back in every request (like a normal cookie), so that the session manager will load the right session file on the server.
