# Forms

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Most websites are using a lot of forms

* Login
* Update user information
* Search something
* Upload a file
* Request/Send some data to an API
* ...
</div><div>

Unfortunately, these forms are also attack vectors if the data received isn't properly handled server-side.

* SQLi injections <small>(ex: execute SQL code on the target)</small>
* Remote Code/Command Execution (RCE)
  * Command injection <small>(ex: run a command on the target)</small>
  * Code injection <small>(ex: upload and run a php script on the target)</small>
* File inclusion <small>(ex: access files/include a malicious script)</small>
* Server-Side Request Forgery <small>(ex: use the server to query another server)</small>
* XSS injections <small>(ex: inject code executed by others users or the staff)</small>
* ...

## HTML GET and POST forms

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The two most well-known forms are **GET** and **POST** forms. They are similar in every way, aside the way they are sending data.

### ➡️HTML forms

Before continuing, it's important to note that a form is something like this. There is a bunch of input fields <small>(not necessarily `<input>`)</small> that may not even be inside the `form` tag. Some may be hidden, but regardless of being shown/hidden, only fields that have a **name** will be sent to the server, along their value.

```html
<!-- data will be sent to /handle_form.php -->
<form method="post" action="/handle_form.php" id="example">
  <input type="text" name="name" value="toto">
  <input type="text" name="password" value="ToTo">
  <input type="text" name="secret" value="007" hidden>
  <input type="text" value="not send">
</form>
<input type="text" name="external" value="0" form="example" hidden>
```

It will generate the following request with name and value joined with a equals (`=`), and pairs separated with an ampersand (`&`).

```http request
POST /handle_form.php HTTP/1.1

name=toto&password=ToTo&secret=007&external=0
```
