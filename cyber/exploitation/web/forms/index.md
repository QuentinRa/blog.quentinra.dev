<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Most websites are using a lot of forms

* Login
* Update user information
* Search something
* Upload a file
* Request/Send some data to an API

Unfortunately, these forms are also attack vectors if the data received isn't properly handled server-side.

* SQLi injections <small>(ex: execute SQL code on the target)</small>
* Remote Code/Command Execution (RCE)
  * Command injection <small>(ex: run a command on the target)</small>
  * Code injection <small>(ex: upload and run a php script on the target)</small>
* File inclusion <small>(ex: access files/include a malicious script)</small>
* Server-Side Request Forgery <small>(ex: use the server to query another server)</small>
* XSS injections <small>(ex: inject code executed by others users or the staff)</small>
