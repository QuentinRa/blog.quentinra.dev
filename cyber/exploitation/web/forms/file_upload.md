# File upload

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A hacker could try to upload a script, and then find a way to run it. The script usually open a **reverse shell**, meaning a shell on the target, that can be access from the hacker computer.

**Bypass filters**

* Try `xxx.png.php` to bypass stupid filters
* Try the null byte `xxx.php%00.png` <small>(PHP < 5.3.4)</small>
* Try intercepting the request, changing the content type, if the server is only checking the content-type.

> Do not use public/folders available to the user, if it's not needed. If you still do, do not use common names that could be found with forced browsing.

**Reverse shell**

To avoid alerting IDS, the reverse shell should use a port that would not be suspected such as `443` (HTTPS).
