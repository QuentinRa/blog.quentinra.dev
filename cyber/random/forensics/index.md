Volatility is a free memory forensics tool.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Install on Linux</summary>

It wouldn't work with `apt-get install volatility` on Kali-2022, so I had to do things manually, and it was tiring because it uses python2. There is a version for [python3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3/tree/stable) in development.

* `git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility.git`
* First patch ([source](https://alvinisonline.medium.com/volatility-importerror-no-module-named-crypto-hash-e515092fd8e3))
    * `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py`
    * `sudo python2 get-pip.py`
    * `sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python2-dev`
* Second patch
    * `pip2 install pycryptodome`
    * `pip2 install --upgrade setuptools`
    * `pip2 install distorm3`
    * `python2 vol.py -h`
* You should add an alias: `alias vol='python2 /path/to/vol.py'`
* `vol -h`
</details>

In order to use Volatility, you need a memory capture (usually, a .raw file). Try checking out [FTK Imager](https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-4-2-0), [Redline](https://www.fireeye.com/services/freeware/redline.html), [DumpIt.exe](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Dumpit), [winDD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/windd/)...

Volatility need to know on which version of Windows it should base its analysis. It's called profiles, and you can run `imageinfo` to find which profiles you can use.

```bash
$ vol -f memory_capture_file imageinfo
# Suggested Profile(s): ...
```

If the following commands are working, then the profile you took is the right one. You can view active processes/connections

```bash
# processes
$ vol -f memory_capture_file --profile=a_profile pslist
# connections
$ vol -f memory_capture_file --profile=a_profile netscan
# hidden processes
$ vol -f memory_capture_file --profile=a_profile psxview
# both actives, and actives+hidden
vol -f memory_capture_file --profile=a_profile ldrmodules > output
```

Malicious processes will most likely try to hide themselves. If you process is neither InLoad, InInit, InMem, then it's suspicious. You can use grep on the output to check if there is a process like this.

```bash
$ grep -o '^.*False.*False.*False.*' output
```

Processes aren't the only place to inspect. We can also check for unexpected patches in the standard system DLLs.

```bash
$ vol -f memory_capture_file --profile=a_profile apihooks
```

Look for injected code, and dump it

```bash
$ vol -f memory_capture_file --profile=a_profile malfind -D dest
```

View all the DLLs loaded into memory

```bash
$ vol -f memory_capture_file --profile=a_profile dlllist
# dump them
$ vol -f memory_capture_file --profile=a_profile --pid=infected_process_pid dlldump -D dest
```

## Assembly

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

One level above binary (010010...), we have a language called assembly which is basically written in instructions specific to a set of machines (Intel, ARM...). You need to use the appropriate tool according to the kind of application.

* `strace`: trace of a program (systemcalls)
* `strings`: extract readable strings in a binary
