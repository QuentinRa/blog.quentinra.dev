# Encoding

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Encoding, unlike encryption, is simply another way of presenting data. Anyone that know the algorithm used for encryption, can easily decode the message. In most cases, it's usually

* base32 <small>[A-Z] and [2-7] or [A-V] and [0-9]...</small>
* base64 <small>(a-Z, 0-9, +, /, and "=" for padding)</small> üìå
* hexadecimal <small>(radix/base 16)</small>

You can use [CyberChef](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef) (19.2k ‚≠ê) to encode/decode a message. They have an [online version here](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

## Base64

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div class="align-self-center">

Base64 is usually used to encode an image/..., so that we can transfer it as a string. Most base64 strings are ending with "=", or "==".
