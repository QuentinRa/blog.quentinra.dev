# H@cking process

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The Cyber Kill Chain model identifies 7 steps in the hacking process

1. Reconnaissance: investigate the target (passive, and active recon)
2. Weaponization: create/prepare an exploit
3. Delivery: deliver your exploit
4. Exploitation: make the exploit used
5. Installation: install a malware
6. Command&Control: get a remote shell on the victim
7. Actions on objective: accomplish the goal

For a penetration tester, it's more something like that

* **Investigation**: (passive) information gathering
* **Discovery**: enumerate/scan the target to find running applications, and services
* **Exploitation**: find a way to get in, once you got a **foothold**
* **Privilege Escalation**: try to get root/administrator (horizontal/vertical escalation)
* **Post-exploitation**: hide your traces...

## Investigation

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

* Learn more about the company, programming languages, software...

* Find targets that may be used for an attack, for instance, a server used with a subdomain for another purpose
</div><div>

...

</div></div>

<hr class="sr">

## Discovery

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

* Find running services, their version...

* Find the running OS

</div><div>

* If there is a website, check the web server section to find what you should look for.
  * Look for a Framework (if any)
  * Try to do **forced browsing**
  * Try to find **logic flaws**
  * ...
</div></div>

<hr class="sl">

## Exploitation

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* Try to find vulnerabilities in running services

* Try to bruteforce credentials on running services
</div><div>

* Try to exploit the website
</div></div>

<hr class="sl">

## Privilege Escalation

*You can escalate horizontally (use another user) and vertically (get a higher level of privileges)*

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

**Find more infos about the computer** üó∫Ô∏è

If you can, try to see the computer as its users do, because you may find some interesting stuff.

**Get to root using privilege escalation** üòé

As you can't do much as a regular user, that's the main goal when getting inside.

</div><div>

**Fetch data** ü™ô

* Try to look for backups
* Try to look for mails/conversations
* Try to look the browser history of the target
* Try to look the command history of the target
* Try to look for passwords saved in notes
</div></div>

<hr class="sr">

## Post-exploitation

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

* Cleanup logs

* Mess with timestamp/... to complicate forensics

* Leave a backdoor

* Edit software configurations / users permissions

* Use this machine as a starting point. Scan the network to discover more vulnerable machines.
</div><div>

* Steal (more?) private information <small>(files, photos, emails, authentication tokens, source code...)</small>

* defacing the public website / redirect to a malicious website
