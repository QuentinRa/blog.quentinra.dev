Almost all the time, password are **hashed**. It means that some "clear text" is passed to a one-way function that returns (=digest) a hash. One-way means that you can't get back the password from the hash. But, we can check if a password has generated a hash, so it's a useful, and a (supposedly) secure way of storing a password.

Usually, hackers create **rainbow tables**, or dictionaries, in which hashes are mapped to passwords. This allows tools to easily give them back the password, if it's in the dictionary. This is possible, because, by default, the same password will generate the same hash. To avoid such attacks, hash functions are taking a parameter called **salt**, and only the same salt should produce the same hash.

> The hash brute-forcing tools will usually take a wordlist with passwords to try. You could use rockyou.txt which is an infamous wordlist of passwords <small>(data breach of rockyou.com in 2009)</small>. See [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords). 

> hash brute-forcing tools are (usually) using your CPU to computer results faster. On VM, they may be less efficient, as the VM itself is taking a lot of resources.

The most important use of hashing is for integrity. We generate a hash of file/..., and make it available with the file. Others can generate the hash of the file after they download it. If both are the same, then it means that the content was not tempered with.

> Ex: HMAC.
</div></div>

> Some hashing functions are proven to be faulty, such as [SHA1](https://shattered.io/), or [MD5](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/), as two different password generated the same hash (hash collision), which means that using a different password that intended, you could log in into the victim account.

## Find which algorithm generated this hash

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There are a few solutions to find which kind a hash algorithm was used to generate a hash. We consider in the following, that the hash is stored inside a file called "hash".

Historically, there was [hash-identifier](https://github.com/blackploit/hash-identifier) (399‚≠ê), but it's kinda old (2011).

```bash
$ cat hash | hash-identifier
$ hash-identifier "some_hash"
```

[hashID](https://github.com/psypanda/hashID) (1.2k ‚≠ê, not updated since 2015)

```bash
$ cat hash | hashid
$ hashid "some_hash"
```
</div><div>

[Name-that-hash](https://github.com/HashPals/Name-That-Hash) (1.1k ‚≠ê, fork of hashID). There is an [online version](https://nth.skerritt.blog/). The program is giving you john (JtR), and the hashcat (hc) format üöÄ! 

```bash
# sudo apt install name-that-hash
$ nth -t "some_hash"
$ nth -f hash
```

[haiti](https://github.com/noraj/haiti/) (309 ‚≠ê). The program is giving you john (JtR), and the hashcat (hc) format üöÄ!

```bash
$ sudo gem install haiti-hash
$ haiti "some_hash"
```

> You might have to do it manually too. Some well-known one are "\\$1\\$" <small>(cisco, old linux)</small>, "\\$2\\$, \\$2a\\$, \\$2b\\$, \\$2x\\$, \\$2y\\$" <small>(bcrypt, web)</small>, or "$6" <small>(sha512crypt, modern linux)</small>. You can find a lot of examples [on hashcat website](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes).

## hashcat / MD5Hashing

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

My experience with [hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat) (15.9k ‚≠ê) has been worse than john, but it's quite well-known, and popular.
</div><div>

[MD5Hashing](https://md5hashing.net/) is a quite useful websites to crack a hash, while it only work if the database has a record of this hash.

## Cracking a hash

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

You can use <small>(Jumbo)</small> [**John the Ripper**](https://github.com/openwall/john) (6.9 ‚≠ê) to try to bruteforce a hash. Put the hash in a file, for instance "hash".

You can use the default wordlist, and let john guess the format. Unfortunately, it's more efficient to provide both arguments, especially the format.

```bash
# use quotes, because $ won't be interpreted inside quotes
$ echo 'some_hash' > hash
$ john hash
$ john 'some_hash'
```

List formats <small>(you don't need it with nth/haiti, as they give you the format)</small>. Note that standard formats, such as MD5, are starting with "raw-".

```bash
$ john --list=formats | grep -i "md5"
```

```bash
$ john hash --format=raw-md5
$ john hash --format=raw-md4
$ john hash --format=raw-sha1
```

</div><div>

You can provide a wordlist

```bash
# on Kali
$ john hash --format=raw-md4 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
# multiple lists
$ cat wordlist1 wordlist2 wordlist3 > wordlist123
$ john hash --format=raw-md4 --wordlist=wordlist123
```
</div></div>

## Linux shadow hash cracking

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Modern Linux are using `sha512crypt`. Use name-that-hash, or any other tools to find the format if needed. The easy way is only passing the hash of the user you want

```bash
$ john hash --format=sha512crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
</div><div>

But, there is a more complicated way. I think it's useful if using john "single" mode.

```bash
$ unshadow /path/to/stolen_passwd /path/to/stolen_shadow > hash
$ john hash --format=sha512crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

Note that "unshadow" simply replaced the "x" in "passwd", with the password in "shadow", as you would find in some old linux distros.
</div></div>

## Windows password cracking

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Modern Windows are using the hash format "NT", also referred as "NTLM", because "LM" was the previous hash format.

```bash
$ john hash --format=nt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
</div><div>
</div></div>

## GPG passphrase cracking

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The `gpg` tool can be used to encrypt files, using a passphrase, which is like a password. It can also be used to sign something. For instance, GitHub allow you to sign your commits using GPG keys.

To encrypt something, you could do this. It will generate a `file.gpg`

```bash
$ gpg --cipher-algo AES-256 --symmetric file
```

And, to decrypt <small>(no passphrase is asked if it is cached)</small>

```bash
$ gpg -d file.gpg
# generate back file
```
</div><div>

You can **crack a gpg passphrase** using john too! But, you need to convert the gpg passphrase to a hash first.

```bash
$ sudo gpg2john file.pgp > hash
```

Then, use john as usual, with the format "gpg"

```bash
$ john --format=gpg hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

> If by any means you got someone's private key that was used to encrypt this file <small>(a key may be used instead of a passphrase)</small>, then use `gpg --import xxx.key` to import it, and decrypt the file as usual.
</div></div>

## SSH private key - passphrase cracking

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Some users are using a key instead of a password while connecting to a server via SSH, because, as long as the key do not leak, it's more secure than sending credentials.

```bash
ssh -i key
```
</div><div>

The key is usually protected by a passphrase. You can use `ssh2jhon` to convert it to a file that `john` can try to break.

```bash
$ ssh2jhon key > hash
$ john --format=ssh hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
</div></div>

<hr class="sr">

## RAR password cracking

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

As for SSH, first convert the password to a file compatible with john.

```bash
$ rar2john hello.rar > hash
$ john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
</div><div>

If you found the password, you can unrar your rar with

```bash
$ unrar x hello.rar
# enter the password
```
</div></div>

<hr class="sl">

## ZIP password cracking

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

As for RAR, first convert the password to a file compatible with john.

```bash
$ zip2john hello.zip > hash
$ john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
</div><div>

If you found the password, you can unzip your zip with

```bash
$ unzip hello.zip
# enter the password
```
</div></div>
