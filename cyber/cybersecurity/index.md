A lot of stuff to get started in cybersecurity, including websites to learn, practice, find news, look for news, along with CVE lookup, and websites to check if your credentials leaked, or stuff like that.

## Exploits / CVE lookup

CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-ID.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/), and the command [searchsploit](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb). Useful to find exploits, and test them.

* [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Basic&results_type=overview&search_type=all)

* [attackerkb.com](https://attackerkb.com/): the community is giving reviews on CVEs.
</div><div>

* [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/), and their new website: [cve.org](https://www.cve.org/). This is basically of big list of CVE, regardless of them being exploitable, or not.

* [security.snyk.io](https://security.snyk.io/): the interface is nicer,  through it's not as generic / covering as much CVEs as others.
