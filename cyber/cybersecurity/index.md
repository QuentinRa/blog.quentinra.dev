## Random vocabulary

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* **Cyber/Data Breach**: a leak of data
* **Vulnerability**/**weakness**: a failure/flaw in a system
* **Exploits**: code that make use of a vulnerability to gain access to a machine, install a malware, steal data...
* **Social engineering**: hackers manipulate someone, to make them compromise the system, or do something that benefit them.

A look at cyberattacks categories ([source](https://www.malwarebytes.com/))

* **ransomware** üîí: lock your system, ask for a ransom.

</div><div>

* **0 Day**/Zero day: an unknown vulnerability that was just discovered
* **Advanced Persistent Threat** (APT): usually, a hacker want to remain as long as possible within an infected network. They are using backdoors, and keep updating the code to avoid being discovered.
* **RansomwareAsAService** (RAAS): hackers selling their skills to other hackers, in exchange for a part of their benefices. There is also "MalwareAsAService" (MAAS), which is the same with malware.

## Exploits / CVE lookup

CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-ID.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/), and the command [searchsploit](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb) (7.5k ‚≠ê). Useful to find exploits, and test them.

* [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Basic&results_type=overview&search_type=all): a reference üìå

* [attackerkb.com](https://attackerkb.com/): community reviews on CVEs. There is a tool similar to searchsploit [akb-explorer](https://github.com/horshark/akb-explorer) (33‚≠ê).

* [vulners](https://vulners.com/) (ex: [CVE-2016-1531](https://vulners.com/cve/CVE-2016-1531))) is a big search engines for vulnerabilities.

</div><div>

* [CVE details](https://www.cvedetails.com/): interface easy to use

* [cve.circl.lu](https://cve.circl.lu/): quite readable, as they get to the point, with a readable interface

* [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/), and their new website: [cve.org](https://www.cve.org/). This is basically of big list of CVE, regardless of them being exploitable, or not.

* [security.snyk.io](https://security.snyk.io/): the interface is nicer,  through it's not as generic / covering as much CVEs as others.
