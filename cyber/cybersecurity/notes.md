# Notes

**offensive security**

Look for vulnerabilities, recommend patches. Exploiting bugs. Finding loopholes. Gain unauthorized access.

* **penetration tester**: "Responsible for testing technology products for finding exploitable security vulnerabilities." (web security, network security knowledge, use various programming languages, cloud security)
* **Red Teamer**: "Plays the role of an adversary, attacking an organization and providing feedback from an enemy's perspective."
* **Security Engineer**: "design, monitor, and maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks".

**defensive Security**. 
  * **Security Analyst** (monitor - splunk?)
  * **Incident Responder** (impact? goal? what can they do? - Volatility?)
  * **malware analysis**

Detect, and stop attacks. Monitor, analyze. Investigate infected computers, try to find how they were hacked, track down cybercriminals.
