# H@cking process

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The Cyber Kill Chain model identifies 7 steps in the hacking process

1. Reconnaissance: investigate the target (passive, and active recon)
2. Weaponization: create/prepare an exploit
3. Delivery: deliver your exploit
4. Exploitation: make the exploit used
5. Installation: install a malware
6. Command&Control: get a remote shell on the victim
7. Actions on objective: accomplish the goal

For a penetration tester, it's more something like that

* **Investigation** (passive): information gathering
* **Discovery** (active): enumerate/scan the target to find running applications, and services
* **Exploitation**: find a way to get in, get a **foothold**
* **Privilege Escalation**: try to get root/administrator (horizontal/vertical escalation)
* **Post-exploitation**: accomplish the goal, hide your traces...
