* protocols can be used for network authentication in windows domains
* Kerberos: Used by any recent version of Windows. This is the default protocol in any recent domain. Users who log into a service using Kerberos will be assigned tickets. Think of tickets as proof of a previous authentication. The initial ticket is a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) that allow a user to request other tickets without sending credentials such as when accessing another service (share/db/...).
* NetNTLM: Legacy authentication protocol kept for compatibility purposes.
