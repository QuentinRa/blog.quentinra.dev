## Windows environment

*Note that you may not be able to use Linux paths such as `/` instead of `c:\\`, as I'm using bellow.*

**Windows files** <small>(it may not be `/Windows`, see `$Env:windir`/`$Env:systemroot`)</small>

* in a file explore, enter `%windir%` (or `%systemroot%`)
* `/Windows/System32/config/`: location where the **Security Account Manager** (**SAM**) database file is stored. This file is used to store users, their passwords, their groups... Modern versions of Windows use the NT hash format, commonly referred as NTLM, as the previous format was LM.

* `lsass` is responsible for authentication within Windows. There is [mimikatz/kiwi](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) (16.2k ‚≠ê) to extract passwords from the memory. For instance, if there is a task running belonging to a user, even if they are not logged in, we can get their password.
