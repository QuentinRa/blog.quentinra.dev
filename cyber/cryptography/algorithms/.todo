------------------

We are picking two **prime numbers** $p$ and $q$, and deducting both $n = p * q$ and $\phi(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)$. The, use **BÃ©zout** to find the coefficients that we will call $d$ and $e$.

* **Public key**: $(n, e)$ (used by others to encrypt)
* **Private key**: $(n, d)$ (used by only me, to decrypt)

To encrypt a message $T$, simply do $S = T^e\ (mod\ n)$, while the message is supposed to be a number $\lt n$.

To decrypt a message $S$, simply do $T = S^d\ (mod\ n)$.

> This is working, because an attacker would have a lot of prime numbers to test ($10^{497}$ for $n \approx 10^{1000}$) to find back $\phi(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)$ from $n$.
