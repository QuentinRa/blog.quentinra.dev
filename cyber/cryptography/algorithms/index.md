# Algorithms in Cryptography

Cryptography is the knowledge related to the encryption and decryption of messages via one, or more algorithms. There are two kind of algorithms: symmetric algorithms, and asymmetric algorithms.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Symmetric algorithms</summary>

In symmetric algorithms, **both** of the sender and the receiver know the key: k. Algorithm are known to the public.

* **A** use an algorithm C to encrypt the message with the key k, generating a cipher (`message encrypté`) c : `c = C(k, m)`
* **B** use an algorithm D to decrypt the message with the same key k : `m = D(k, c)`

`k` should be at least 128 bits for a symmetric algorithm to be acceptable.

<summary>Caesar cipher (<code>Code de César</code>)</summary>

Caesar was replacing letters like this $a \to d,\ b \to e,\ ...,\ z \to c$. Each letter is associated with another one "k" letters forward (k=3 in the previous example), modulus the number of letters (26). To decrypt, for each letter, go backward by "k" letters to get back the decrypted letter.

* **Possible values for k**: $26$
* **Secure**: weak
  * Bruteforce attack
  * Entropy attack

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Substitution cipher</summary>

On the same idea as the caesar cipher, the **substitution cipher** is associating each letter by another like $a \to w,\ b \to e,\ etc.$. The key is a dictionary of 26 letters (a-z).

* **Possible values for k**: $26! ≈ 2^{88.4}$

<summary>Both are vulnerable to an entropy attack</summary>

In any language, there are letters, 2-letters long words, 3-letters long words, and so on, that are statistically very likely to be in any text. In French/English, the most common letter is `e`, while there are a lot of common words such as `de`, `du`, `le`, `la`... To find them, you need to analyze the frequency of letters/words.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Vigenère cipher (<code>Cryptage en bloc de Vigenère</code>)</summary>

This is a caesar cipher, but split into blocs. The goal was to avoid entropy attacks, because a same letter will most likely be enciphered as  different ciphertext letters.

* **Possible values for k**: $26^n$
* **Secure**: weak
  * Entropy attack to find the size of the key, because the key is repeated
  * Once the size of the key if found, each bloc is handled as we would for a caesar cipher

## One Time Pad (`Masque jetable`)

![Type: Symmetric](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Symmetric-7cfc00)&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Complexity: easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Complexity-easy-7cfc00)

The **One Time Pad**, or One Time password, abbreviated as **OTP**, is a cryptographic algorithm with a good level of security, as long as some considerations are taken, created in 2017.  It is part of the family of **stream cipher** (`chiffrement par flot`).

* `m` is a message of length `n`
* `k` is a key of length `n`
* $C = m \oplus k$
* $D = c \oplus k$

The operator $\oplus$ (XOR, `ou exclusif`) is basically this: $(a+b)%2$, with both arguments binary numbers.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Example</summary>

* **Message**: $10011$
* **Key** (encrypt): $01010$
* **Cipher text**: $11001$
* **Key** (decrypt): $01010$
* **Message**: $10011$
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Concerns</summary>

* The key is as long as the message, making it hard to use
* The key must be used only once (**Two Time Pad**)
* OPT do not control/ensure the integrity of the message.

## Knapsack problem (`sac-à-dos`) of Merkle-Hellman

![Type: Asymmetric](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Asymmetric-7cfc00)&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Knapsack problem</summary>

The most know bag/knapsack problem is the **0-1 knapsack problem**. You got a "bag/Knapsack" of numbers <small>(ex: 23, 5, 11, 2, 55)</small>. Your message is made of `0`, and `1`, and using this method `1` means you picked something from the bag, `0` means you didn't. Then, make the sum of the numbers you picked in the bag to create the **cipher**. Note that you **will have to split the message into groups** having the size of the knapsack.

* **Knapsack**: $2, 5, 11, 23, 55$ (up to you, size=6)
* **Message**: $1100111001 = 11001\ 10001$ (group of 6)
* **Cipher**
  * $2 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 55 = 62$ (first group)
  * $2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 55 = 57$ (second group)
* **Cipher text**: $62, 57$
</details>

<details class="details-e"> 
<summary>Super-increasing knapsack problem</summary>

An easy knapsack problem is the **super-increasing knapsack problem**, in which every next entry of the bag is greater than the sum of the previous terms. It make it easy to decipher the message without the key, as if the cipher is greater or equals than the current greatest value of the knapsack, then it is inside the knapsack of the message.

* **Knapsack**: $2, 5, 11, 23, 55$
* **Cipher**: 62
* Decipher
  * $62 \ge 55$ ? yes, then 55 is in.
  * $7 \ge 23$ ? no, then 23 is not in
  * $7 \ge 11$ ? no, then 11 is not in.
  * $7 \ge 5$ ? yes, then 5 is in.
  * $2 \ge 2$ ? yes, then 2 is in.
* **Result**: 11001

Merkle-Hellman knapsack problem is **one of the earliest public-key algorithm**. The private key is a super-increasing knapsack problem, while the public key is the private key modified a bit to be a knapsack problem.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Generate a public key</summary>

We will pick a value $N$ greater than the sum of the values in the Knapsack, and a number $W$, so that $N \wedge W|1$ (=no common divisor aside 1).

* We are picking $N=113$, $W=27$
* We calculated $W^{-1} = 67\ (\text{mod}\ 113)$
* **Knapsack** (public key)
  * We are multiplying the private key by $W$, modulus $N$
  * Ex: $27 * 2 = 54\ (\text{mod}\ 113)$
  * $((2, 5, 11, 23, 55) * W)\ mod\ N = 54, 22, 71, 56, 16$
  * Public key: $(54, 22, 71, 56, 16)$

<summary>Public-key exchange</summary>

* **A** is generating a private-key using the super-increasing knapsack ($(2, 5, 11, 23, 55)$)
* **A** is generating a public-key $(54, 22, 71, 56, 16)$, using a $N=113$, and $W=27$ that **B** know
* **A** encrypt a message using the public-key, and send the cipher text to **B**
  * $54 + 22 + 0 + 0 + 16 = 92$ (first group)
  * $54 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 16 = 70$ (second group)
  * **Cipher text**: $92, 70$
* **B** generate the private-key using the public-key, and both $W$, and $N$
  * We are multiplying the public key by $W^{-1}$, modulus $N$
  * We get the private key: $2, 5, 11, 23, 55$
* **B** decrypt the message
  * We multiply the message by $W^{-1}$, modulus $N$
  * We get $62$, and $57$
  * We solve them using the super-increasing knapsack problem
  * The message was: $1100110001$

## Diffie–Hellman key exchange

![Type: Asymmetric](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Asymmetric-7cfc00)&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Complexity: intermediate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Complexity-intermediate-7cfc00)

A is sending a message to B. Both are agreeing on two numbers $p$ and $g$ with $(p-1) \wedge g\ |\ 1$ (=the only divisor is 1), and they are picking a private number (resp. $a$ and $b$, lesser than $p$).

A is sending $g^a\ (mod\ p)$ to B (resp. b for B to A). The common key for A is $(g^a)^b\ (mod\ p)$ and for B, it is $(g^b)^a\ (mod\ p)$. They **both** have the same number, but they do not know about the exponent of the other.

## Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)

![Type: Asymmetric](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Asymmetric-7cfc00)&nbsp;&nbsp;
![Complexity: intermediate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Complexity-intermediate-7cfc00)

This is an algorithm that is secure, the more $n$ is bigger. The arguments that must be given are $k$, and $n$. As of 2022, it's recommended that $n$ must be at least 2048 bits.

* Given $n$, find two **prime numbers** $p$ and $q$, giving us $n = p * q$ <small>(which one is $p$, or which one is $q$, is up to you)</small>
* Calculate phi(n): $\phi(n) = (p-1) * (q – 1)$
* Use Bézout on phi(n), and k, to find $d$, and $e$
  * Solve $B(k,\ \phi(n)) = k * u + phi(n) * v = 1$
  * $d = k$
  * $e = u$
* **Encrypt**: $C(m, n, e) = m^e\ (mod\ n)$
* **Decrypt**: $D(c, n, d) = c^d\ (mod\ n)$

The **public key is $(n,e)$**, while the **private key is $(n,d)$**. Senders will use the public key to encrypt a message, while the receiver will use it's private key to decrypt a message.

An attacker would have a lot of prime numbers to test ($10^{497}$ for $n \approx 10^{1000}$) to find back $\phi(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)$ from $n$.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Example: RSA(n=35, k=7)</summary>

* $35 = 5 * 7$, $p=5$, $q=7$
* $\phi(N) = (5-1) * (7-1) = 24$
* $B(7, 24) = 7 * u + 24 * v = 1$
  * One solution: $u=d=7$, $v=-2$
* **Encrypt**
  * (2) $2^7 \mod 35 = 23$
  * (3) $3^7 \mod 35 = 17$
  * (4) $4^7 \mod 35 = 4$
* **Decrypt**
  * (23) $23^7 \mod 35 = 2$
  * (17) $17^7 \mod 35 = 3$
  * (4) $4^7 \mod 35 = 4$
