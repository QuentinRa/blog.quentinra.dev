# Basics of Cryptography

Cryptography is the knowledge related to the **encryption** and **decryption** of messages. This course is more of a mathematical course than a programming course. This is because most of the algorithms are using prime numbers, modulus, and a lot of stuff like this.

## Prime numbers (`Nombres premiers`)

A prime number is a number **greater or equals to 2**, which is **only divisible by 1 and itself**.

* ✅: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.
* ❌: 4 (→2), 6 (→2, →3), 9 (→3), 10 (→2, →5), etc.

* **French**: `Décomposition en produit de facteurs premiers`
* **Definition**: Every number ($\ge 2$) can be expressed as a product of prime numbers
* Examples
    * $27 = 3 * 9 = 3^3$
    * $60 = 6 * 10 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 2 = 2^2 * 3 * 5$

## Congruence

Let a and b two numbers. We are saying that $a$ is **congruent** (`congru`, $\equiv$) with $b$ **modulus** (`modulo`) $m$, if we can find a $q$ giving us

@
a = b + m * q
@

We are using one of the notations below

<div>
\[
\begin{align}
a \equiv b\ (m)\\
a \equiv b\ (mod\ m)\\
a \equiv [b]\\
\end{align}
\]
</div>

> **Ex**: $27 \equiv 3\ (mod\ 12)$ as we have $12*2 + 3$<br>
> **Formula**: Given $a = m * q + r$, then $a \equiv r\ (mod\ m)$

If you need to evaluate the value $r$ given modulus $m$ **of a complex value** $a$, then simply rewrite $a$ as a product of factors, and evaluate the modulus on each one.

* Ex: $256\ \text{mod}\ 7 = 2^8 = 2^3 * 2^3 * 2^2$
  * $2^3 = 8 \equiv 1\ (\text{mod}\ 7)$
  * $2^2 = 4 \equiv 4\ (\text{mod}\ 7)$
  * Giving us $256 \equiv 1 * 1 * 4 \equiv 4 \ (\text{mod}\ 7)$
* Ex: $2021\ \text{mod}\ 3 = 2000 + 20 + 1 = 2 * 10^3 + 2 * 10^2 + 1$
  * $10 \equiv 1\ \text{mod}\ 3$
  * $10^2 = 10 * 10 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod}\ 3)$
  * $10^3 = 10 * 10 * 10 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod}\ 3)$
  * $2021= 2 * 1 + 2 * 1 + 1 = 5 \equiv 2 \ (\text{mod}\ 3)$

This is called **Euler theorem** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem)).
