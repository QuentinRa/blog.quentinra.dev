üìå **VMWare workstation** üìå

* **Link**: [VMware Workstation 16.2.4 Player](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/details?downloadGroup=WKST-PLAYER-1624&productId=1039&rPId=91446)
* **Notes**
  * Some are sharing pre-configured machines ready to install
  * The UX is better than in Virtual Box
  * At least in the free version, there is fewer features than Virtual Box, such as to easily resize permanently the screen, and their documentation is not that good.

‚≠ê **Oracle VirtualBox** ‚≠ê

* **Link**: [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* **Notes**
    * There are always problems, like you need to go deep into the settings, in order to set a lot of values, and cross-finger while praying that they are the right ones for your machine.
    * There are not "ready to sail", like if you want to create two machines, and send a ping from one to another, you can't because they have the same IP, you need to do some manual work, and that's a very bad UX.
    * There are a lot of nice features, when it works that is.
