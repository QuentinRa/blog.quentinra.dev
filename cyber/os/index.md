## 3389/tcp / Remote Desktop Protocol

*If there is an open port, such as `3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server`, you can try to connect to the target (if you have credentials).*

[Remmina](https://github.com/FreeRDP/Remmina) (1.8k ‚≠ê) that can be installed with `apt install remmina` is an easy-to-use tool allowing you to open access a remote desktop.

* `remmina`: start the graphical interface
  * Enter the IP of the target
  * Enter the credentials
  * Connect
* Then, I would advise to toggle "dynamic resolution update" in the left menu, so that you have a bigger screen.
