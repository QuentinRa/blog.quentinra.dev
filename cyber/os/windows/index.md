## Windows environment

*Note that you may be able to use Linux paths such as `/` instead of `c:\\`.*

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Look for (sensitive?) information** üîë

* `cd /`: the root, maybe you will find something interesting?
* `/Users`: usually, each folder is associated with a user
  * `/Users/xxx/Desktop`
  * `/Users/xxx/Documents`
  * You should also check the trash-box
  * Check browser history / credentials...
* Maybe check `%appdata%`

**Windows files** <small>(it may not be `/Windows`, see `$Env:windir`)</small>

* in a file explore, enter `%windir%`
* `cd /Windows/System32/config/`: this may be a location for the **Security Account Manager** (**SAM**) database file is stored. This file is used to store users, their passwords, their groups...
</div><div>

**Windows services** <small>(usually use "Win‚úñÔ∏èR" to open one)</small>:

* `lusrmgr.msc`: list of users/groups
* `lsass` is responsible for authentication within Windows. There is [mimikatz/kiwi](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) (16.2k ‚≠ê) to extract passwords from the memory. For instance, if there is a task running belonging to a user, even if they are not logged in, we can get their password.

**Random**

* Kerberos is the authentication system in Windows domains.
