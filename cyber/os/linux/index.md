## Linux (automated) enumeration

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There are many scripts checking if there are "common" files, testing commands... in order to look for information that would be useful for you to reach a higher level of privilege.

* [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) (5k ‚≠ê): a script shell
* [traitor](https://github.com/liamg/traitor)  (5k ‚≠ê): a script in Go
* [linux-smart-enumeration](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration) (2k ‚≠ê): a script shell
* [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker) (1k ‚≠ê): a python script
