A command like STAT can provide some added information. The SYST command shows the System Type of the target (UNIX in this case). PASV switches the mode to passive. It is worth noting that there are two modes for FTP:

Active: In the active mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from the FTP server’s port 20.
Passive: In the passive mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from an FTP client’s port above port number 1023.
The command TYPE A switches the file transfer mode to ASCII, while TYPE I switches the file transfer mode to binary. However, we cannot transfer a file using a simple client such as Telnet because FTP creates a separate connection for file transfer.

2 channels: commands, and a new tcp connection to transfer data.
