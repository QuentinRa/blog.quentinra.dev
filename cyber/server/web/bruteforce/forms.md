# Bruteforce forms

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There are two kinds of forms: **GET forms**, in which the parameters of the form are stored within the URL, and anyone opening the URL, will see the form filled with the same input. For instance, a search engine such as Google has a parameter `q` (query) in which the search I made `(hello world)` was stored in.

```
https://www.google.com/search?q=hello+world
https://www.google.com/search?q=hello%20world
```

Search are URL-encoded as a URL is a long suite of characters with no spaces, for instance, space would be either `%20`, or `+`.
</div><div>

Then, we have **POST forms**. They are mostly used for logins/... Once the user submit data, then its encoded, and sent to the server. Even if we have the same URL, the page will be empty for us.

```
https://example.com/login.php
```

The common point between the two are that the data transferred is looking like this: `username=toto&password=toto`, and in both, it's URL-encoded.

## Bruteforce authentication forms using Hydra

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Hydra is mostly used to bruteforce services, but it can also be used with authentication forms.

```bash
$ hydra -l toto -P wordlist URL http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V
```

<p class="mt-3">The request that we will bruteforce is something like this</p>

```none
username=toto&password=xxx
```
</div><div>

This command will

* Attack the form located at `URL/login.php` <small>(the `/login.php`)</small>
* Set the field with the name "username" with "toto"
* Set the field with the name "password" with every entry in the wordlist, on by one
* Consider comme failures (`-F`) any web page that returns the word "incorrect"

You should check the [bruteforce services](../../../random/crack_password/services.md) page to learn more about Hydra.
