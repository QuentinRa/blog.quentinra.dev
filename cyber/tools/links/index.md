# Handful resources in cybersecurity

A list of useful resources (ex: website, gits...) that you may use while learning, or practicing cybersecurity. Basically, this is a list of repositories, learning resources, practicing resources, and useful resources.

## Exploits / CVE lookup

CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-ID.

* [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/), and the command [searchsploit](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb). Useful to find exploits, and test them.
* [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Basic&results_type=overview&search_type=all)
* [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/), and their new website: [cve.org](https://www.cve.org/). This is basically of big list of CVE, regardless of them being exploitable, or not.
* [attackerkb.com](https://attackerkb.com/)

One special mention to **Snyk**: [security.snyk.io](https://security.snyk.io/), because there website is, in my opinion, way better than others.
