# How to contribute

First, you can edit a course directly on the website. You will have to solve a captcha, but this is easy.

You can also [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository). Then simply edit the file(s) you wanted to, and [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

You should check this guide about the [syntax you may use in our files](https://memorize.be/syntax).
