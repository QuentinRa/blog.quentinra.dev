# GitHub pages

[Go back](../../../../_it/dev/git/index.md#advanced-concepts)

An organization or a user can make on GitHub a "GitHub page" project. To summarize, you can make a website from the code of a repository having the same name as your username/organization name. Then GitHub will host the website for you.

Check the [tutorial](https://pages.github.com/).

Your website URL will be like `https://username.github.io/`. You can change that with a custom name, that you brought beforehand for 10$ per year (for a domain.com
for example) by following the steps for [custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).

## Website in Markdown

You may write your website in Markdown. I didn't try, but here are the links that I would check out

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) ([Deployment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/automated/))
* [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/)
* [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/)

You may look for "static site generators", quite a lot of them  [are listed here](https://jamstack.org/generators/) along with this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators).

You can use [form spree](https://formspree.io/) to use forms without coding.
