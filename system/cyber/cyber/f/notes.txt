Your earlier nmap port scan will have shown port 111 running the service rpcbind. This is just an server
that converts remote procedure call (RPC) program number into universal addresses. When an RPC service is started,
it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening and the RPC program number its prepared to serve.

In our case, port 111 is access to a network file system. Lets use nmap to enumerate this.

nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.99.133

DirtyCow
https://dirtycow.ninja/

That C source code is a portion of a kernel exploit called DirtyCow. Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) is a privilege escalation
 vulnerability in the Linux Kernel, taking advantage of a race condition that was found in the way
  the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings.
   An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and
   thus increase their privileges on the system.
