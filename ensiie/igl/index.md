# IGL

IGL "Introduction au gÃ©nie logiciel" is not an easy course. You will need strength and motivation to survive ðŸ‘€. <small>Joke aside, it's hard to learn something. You will have a lot of things used in the graded homework that you didn't "see" during classes</small>.

> In 2021, the version of Papyrus in the school was **4.8.0**, so even if there are newer versions, [install Papyrus 4.8.0](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/modeling/mdt/papyrus/rcp/2020-06/4.8.0/papyrus-2020-06-4.8.0-win64.zip). If you need another version of papyrus that is not on the official website, trick the URL above (it works, that's how I found this version).

## TD8 - Code Generation

We have to write some code, that will be able to generate **Java** and **Documentation** from our **model**. We will test a few ways of doing so.

* [Setup](td8/setup.md) (**hard** ðŸ˜±, **may take around 20 minutes**)
* [Code generation with Xtend](td8/xtend.md) (**medium**)
* [Code generation with Acceleo](td8/acceleo_code.md) (**easy**)
* [Code documentation generation with Acceleo](td8/acceleo_doc.md) (**easy**)
