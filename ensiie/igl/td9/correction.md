If you jumped here before reading every other page, you are a fool ðŸ™„. We don't have something that we can call a correction.

## What they expected us to do

* Your may job was to get the xtend generator working with your model
  * **In 2021**, almost everyone failed to do so
  * [The teacher gave us its generated code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memorize-code/memorize-references/main/special/igl/GeneratedCodefromDesigner.zip)
* The acceleo code generator is not worth your time
  * [The teacher gave us its generated code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memorize-code/memorize-references/main/special/igl/GeneratedCodefromAcceleo.zip) (**it do not compile, hint that we don't care about Acceleo?**)
    * Real was not replaced
    * Missing imports
    * Missing a named package at the root
    * Duplicates functions
    * ...
* And finally, about the acceleo code generator
  * The teacher said that the format do not matters
  * Simply write the code that you may have done in TP, and that's it. The output is quite incomplete, but that do not matters.
