------- Material -------

Material design is a library of pre-made components. Google recommends to use Material UI components as much as possible. The list [of Material components for Android can be found here](https://material.io/components?platform=android).

* Text field: `TextInputLayout` (see [text field](https://material.io/components/text-fields/android#using-text-fields))
* Switch: `SwitchMaterial` (create a switch, change the type in the .xml)

TextInputLayout comes with a built-in functionality to display error messages.
xxx.error = getString(R.string.error)
xxx.error = null // clear
xxx.isErrorEnabled = true

style="?attr/materialButtonOutlinedStyle"

------------------

A task is a collection of activities
Activities are arranged in a stack, known as a back stack
where each new activity the user visits gets pushed onto the back stack for the task
back = remove act on top and destroy it "popping an activity off the stack"
if no more, back to home

There is also a fragment stack in an activity
Navigation library

On an action, there is an attribute "popUpTo". It means that
destination in the stack will be popped off until the last one is the given one.
You may want to even remove the given one, by setting "popUpToInclusive" to true.
For instance, if you start wit A, go to D, and go back to A with popUpTo, you will have AA.

val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND)
    .setType("text/plain")
    .putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "xxx")
    .putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "yyy")
    .putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_EMAIL, "a@b.c")

if (activity?.packageManager?.resolveActivity(intent, 0) != null) {
    startActivity(intent)
}

quantity strings
<plurals name="xxx">
    <item quantity="one">xxx</item>
    <item quantity="other">xxs</item>
</plurals>
Use resources.getQuantityString with quantity="one"/"other"
%1

Call executePendingBindings() after setting the property, which causes the update to execute immediately.
