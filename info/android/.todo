## UI

* scaleType:centerCrop scale without distorting (9patches)

Layout are edited using the layout editor. `res > layout > activity_main.xml`.

Returning on the view

* To place an element in a **ConstraintLayout**, you need to add constraints to it.
* If you give layout_width+height "0dp", android studio will match the constraint. If they are "0", then it basically means "fill".

> You can attach a component to another in a constraint layout. click on one of the four circles on something, and link it ot the circle of another view. By doing so, constraint will be relative to the other view. And, moving the "parent" will move the child.

> * You got options to do things faster using right-click.
> * There is a search bar (ex: for attributes)

## Resources

## Localization

There is a folder `values` in resources. You can add your own folder for a specific case (ex: support another language). In strings.xml, you can add

* a key
* a "default" translation for this key

If you create another folder "values" (ex: `values-fr+ca/strings.xml`), you will keep the key, and change the translation. In the code, you will only reference the "key".

If you created something with a "text" not localized. You can click on the "warning", then expand "Hardcoded text", and click on fix.

* `contentDescription`: what's the purpose of this element
* `importantForAccessibility`: if this element is just decorative, you can set it to no
