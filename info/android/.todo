Material design is a library of pre-made components. Google recommends to use Material UI components as much as possible. The list [of Material components for Android can be found here](https://material.io/components?platform=android).

* Text field: `TextInputLayout` (see [text field](https://material.io/components/text-fields/android#using-text-fields))
* Switch: `SwitchMaterial` (create a switch, change the type in the .xml)

TextInputLayout comes with a built-in functionality to display error messages.
xxx.error = getString(R.string.error)
xxx.error = null // clear
xxx.isErrorEnabled = true
