Bottom Navigation
=> navigates, and you want the color to change,
handle "back-stack" (what is it?)

Navigation component is a collection of libs, and stuff simplifying android navigation.
=> navigation graph: view of screens (called destinations) linked by "action". Click on a screen to see options, args passed...
    There are deep links like in facebook.

=> nav host widget: sort of cardlayout in Java

Navigation Controller
=> findNavController().navigate(dest_or_action_id)

SafeArgs plugin
=> generate classes based on navigation graph
=> XXXArgs
=> XXXDirections

val direction: NavDirections: ZZZDirections.xxxAction()
val direction: NavDirections: ZZZDirections.xxxAction( arg = value )
findNavController().navigate(direction)

in a fragment
val args by navArgs<XXXArgs>()
val argName = args.argName

Navigation UI
=> Options Menus, bottom nav, nav view, nav drawer, action bar, tool bar, collapsed tool bar
=> do "as normal", then setup with nav controller

-----------------

It's possible to have multiples "screens" within one activity, for instance tabs, using fragments. Fragments
are reusable view that can be embed in activities. For instance, a navbar will most likely be a fragment.
It fragment has it own lifecycle.
