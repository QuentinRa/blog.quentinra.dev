Main thread display UI + events (This is (usually) the UI thread.)
Background thread

multitasking / Concurrency

Coroutines enable multitasking, but provide another level of abstraction over simply working with threads.
One key feature of coroutines is the ability to store state, so that they can be halted and resumed. A coroutine may or may not execute.

* job: cancellable work
* CoroutineScope: create coroutines
* Dispatcher: determine thread by used coroutine
    The Main dispatcher will always run coroutines on the main thread,
    while dispatchers like Default, IO, or Unconfined will use other threads.

GlobalScope.launch {}
= as long as the app is running

Suspend signals that a block of code or function can be paused or resumed.
suspend fun() {}
delay(3000)
if call suspend, then suspend

.runBlocking {}
.async {}
    .await()
    Deferred = Promise = Future, promise that a result will be returned later
