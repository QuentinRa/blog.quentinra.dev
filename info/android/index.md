## Views

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mx-0"><div>

Everything displayed on the screen is a `View`.

* Display a text: `TextView`
* Display an image: `ImageView`
* Display a button: `Button`

`View` doesn't means that this is only a "view", a view be clickable/editable...
</div><div>

The layout is handled by a `ViewGroup`. Layouts are edited using the layout editor. There are located in `res > layout`.

* [ConstraintLayout](layouts/ConstraintLayout.md) : arrange elements in a flexible way

</div></div>

## Good practices

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>No HardCoded Text</summary>

If you create a TextField, or something having some text shown to the user, then it's a good practice to put the text inside a file "strings.txt". You can click on the "warning", then expand "Hardcoded text", and click on fix.
</details>
</div><div>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Accessibility</summary>

You have some attributes to increase accessibility

* `contentDescription`: what's the purpose of this element
* `importantForAccessibility`: if this element is just decorative, you can set it to no
</details>
</div></div>

## Resources

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mx-0"><div>

On the left side, or in View > Tools Windows, you got the "Resources Manager". This is a tab in which you can easily track every resource of your application, in other words, files in `res`.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Add a new "drawable" (image)</summary>

* Go to Drawables
* Click on "+"
* Import drawables
* The new file should be in the list
* You can drag, and drop it in the design view (or select it when creating a new imageview)
</details>
</div><div>

Every folder in `res` may have multiples "copies" for different devices/languages. For instance, if there is a view for large screen devices, it will be used instead of the view made of "every" device.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Localization</summary>

To add another language

* Create a new "Android resources directory"
* Click on "Locale" then ">>"
* Select a locale, and optionally a region
* Switch to project view
* Copy, and paste "strings.xml" inside the new folder
* Switch back to android view
* Go in "String" inside the Resources manager
* Click on Open Translations Editor

You can edit locales here! Locales are made of a

* a key
* a translation

Every "strings.xml" shares the sames keys, but different translations. In the code, or in the view, you will only reference the "key", and the appropriate value will be shown according to the user language.
