# Instructions

[Go back](..)

Our news instructions are

* **LSL (Logical Shift Left)**

Move xxx bits to the left, new bits are
set to 0. Not fitting bits are lost (left).

Example: ``111111111111...`` LSL by `4` will becomes
``11111111...0000``.

* **LSR (Logical Shift Right)**

Same as LSL but to the right.

Example: ``111111111111...`` LSR by `4` will becomes
``0000111111111111...``.

* **ASR (Arithmetic shift right)**

We are writing xxx times signe bit, then Rb.
Not fitting bits are lost (right).

Example: ``001110001000...`` ASR by `4` will becomes
``0000001110001000...`` (xxx=4 zeros since the first
was a zero).

* **ROR (rotate right)**

Last xxx bits of Rb register then
Rb. Not fitting bits are lost (right).

Example: ``001110001000...0010`` ROR by `4` then we add
the xxx first and then your register
``0010001110001000...``

* **RRX (rotate right Extended)**

RRX is a bit more complicated
* the old carry bit becomes the first bit
* the old last one bit becomes the new carry bit
* then add Rb

``001110001000...0010`` with a carry of ``1`` RRX
by ``4`` becomes
* carry: ``0``
* value: ``1001110001000...``
