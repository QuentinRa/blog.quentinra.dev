# Usage

[Go back](..)

The form is like

```none
{op}{cond}{S} Rd,Rn,Rb, shift_type shift_amount
```

* ``op`` is ``add``, ``mov``, ...
* ``cond`` is ``ne``, ``eq``, ...
* ``s`` is the save flag
* then you have your registers (Rd, Rn)

and now instead of ``Operand2``, you could write

* ``Rb``, a register that will be used for the
shift, but whose value won't be changed
* ``shift_type``: ASR, LSL, ...
* ``shift_amount``: xxx value

Giving us something like this

```asm6502
; r is shifted by 2
add r0, r0, r1, lsl #2
```
