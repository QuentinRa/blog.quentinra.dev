# Make a system call

[Go back](..)

To make a system call, you need to set the parameters
so the values into the registers but you also
need to put in ``r7`` the system call value
like ``1`` for exit (check system call section).

Then simply write

```asm6502
swi #0
```

for software interaction, that will process the
system call.
