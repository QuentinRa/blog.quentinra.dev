# Constants

[Go back](..)

Constant are called immediate constants because they
are not constants. We are not talking about
``.equ`` but when in the program you are writing
``#0`` for the value 0 (for instance).

In the rest of the course, ``Operand2`` may be a constant.

The problem is that this immediate constant is not a 32 bits
number (int) but a **12 bits** variable so you can't
use some values.

The first 4 bits are the rotation. And the 8 bits
are the value.

<div>
Place the 8bits at the end of a 32bits variable
like you got 32 zeros but replace the 8 last ones
with the last 8 bits of the constant. Then, you
must move your bits, clockwise by
<span>\(2^{rotation}\)</span>.

## Example: from constant to decimal

Taking an example, we would have

* ``0001 00000001``
* on 32 bits ``00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001``
* 0001 in base 2 = 1 in base 10
* so the rotation is 2^1 = 2
* 1/2
* ``10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000``
* 2/2
* ``01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000``
* and our number is ...
* 1073741824 = 2^30

## Example 2: from decimal to constant

Test with ``748 326``

* write on 32 bits ``00000000 00001011 01101011 00100110``
* oh no... 19 bits can't fit a 8bits value
* fail

Test with ``32000``

* write on 32 bits ``00000000 00000000 01111101 00000000``
* 7 bits fit on 8 bits so we are good
* value (8bits): ``01111101``
* trying to guess the rotation
* ``00000000 00000000 00000000 01111101``
* I need to rotate by 24 to have back my 32 bits number
* but... I can't write 2^n = 24
* fail

Test with ``-58``

* write on 32 bits ``10000000 00000000 00000000 00111010``
* 7 bits fit...
* value (8bits): ``11101010``
* we have ``00000000 00000000 00000000 11101010``
* this time, I only need to rotate 2 times
* so I have 2^n = 2 for n=1
* rotation (4 bits): ``0001`` (equals to 1)
* so I will store ``0001 11101010``
* done
