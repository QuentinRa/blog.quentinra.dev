# Typescript

Typescript is a wonderful upgrade of Javascript, allowing
to write a ``.ts`` file an compile it in any version
of javascript creating a ``.js``. The advantages are

* more elements of syntax like enums or
  an advanced syntax
* you can add types to methods, attributes, ...
  to enable the syntax checker and using most
  of your IDE features
