# Cypher

Cypher is a language closes to the SQL, as you got clauses and a syntax quite similar. It's used by Neo4J in their graph database, **and you will need an account to try it out**. You can either use their sandbox, and your database will be hosted in the cloud, or you can host locally your database.

* Create an account
  * [use their online database](https://neo4j.com/sandbox/) database
  * OR [install Neo4J Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/)
* create a new project (a group of databases)
* create a new database
* then start your database

In this course, I will use [this database](https://github.com/memorize-code/memorize-references/raw/main/info/nosql/movies.cypher), created by my teacher, [Stefania Dumbrava](http://web4.ensiie.fr/~stefania.dumbrava/) .
