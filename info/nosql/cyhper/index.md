## Installing Cypher

First, let's install Cypher.
You can use 

* the [online](https://neo4j.com/sandbox/) database
* or [install](https://neo4j.com/download/) Neo4J Desktop

Once you did (after creating an account in both cases),
you should

* create a new project (a group of databases)
* create a new database
* then start your database

If you are planning to use this in a project (like
in Java, JS, PHP or Go) then you should look 
at the [driver page](https://neo4j.com/developer/language-guides/).

You may also try reading the official
documentation [here](https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/).
