## Installing Cypher

First, let's install Cypher.
You can use 

* the [online](https://neo4j.com/sandbox/) database
* or [install](https://neo4j.com/download/) Neo4J Desktop

Once you did (after creating an account in both cases),
you should

* create a new project (a group of databases)
* create a new database
* then start your database

If you are planning to use this in a project (like
in Java, JS, PHP or Go) then you should look 
at the [driver page](https://neo4j.com/developer/language-guides/).

You may also try reading the official
documentation [here](https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/).

If you are a **Jetbrains** user, then
you may enjoy "Graph Database Console" plugin.

[Here](movies.cypher) is a database create by my teacher,
[Stefania Dumbrava](http://web4.ensiie.fr/~stefania.dumbrava/)
that I will use in this course.

## Core concept

Here this is what a query result will looks like

![example](example.png)

You got 

* **4 nodes**, each node is like a tuple in a SQL database,
  they have properties called **attributes**
* **3 edges**, they are the relation between the nodes,
  you may have a lot of them between two nodes and in
  a lot of directions

That's what we call a graph.

## Nodes

A **node** is defined between ``()`` giving you something
like this ``(ref:name{})`` where

* **ref**, is an optional variable name,
  that may be used for storing the node
  for the query
* **:name** is an optional name of the variable, it's like
  a table name in SQL or a class in UML
* **{}** are the attributes of the object, optional
  too. The format for this is JSON 
  (`{ attribute:value, ... }`)

Ex

* ``(:name)`` nodes without properties having the name "name"
* ``(ref:name {attribute:value})`` store in ref a node having the name
  "name" and "value" for "attribute".
* ``(ref {attribute: value})`` store in ref ...

<hr class="sr">

## Edges

An **edges** defined between ``[]`` and two nodes
giving you something like this ``node-[ommited]->node``
where

* **node** is a node (can be the same or two different ones),
  you can omit both otherwise you must give both
* **omitted** is also a node (so `(ref: name{})`) where
  * **ref**: will be used to store the edge
  * **name**: name of the edge like "player-Playing->game"
    Playing here 
  * **{}**: the properties of the edge, you may
    see this as the attributes in a **association class**
    in UML

You got a lot of kind of edges

* ``--`` : anonymous without direction
* ``-->`` : anonymous with direction
* ``-[:name]->`` : named "name" with direction

Ex

* ``(:Movie)<-[e]-(:ShowbizPerson)``: store
  into e the edge(s) from a ShowbizPerson to a Movie
* ``(:ShowbizPerson)-[e]->()``: store in r the edge(s)
  from ShowbizPerson kind of nodes to any other kind of
  nodes

## Make a request

A request will looks like this

```sql
// simple request
MATCH (ref)
RETURN ref;

// more complex
MATCH (ref:n≈ìud)
WHERE condition
RETURN ref.attribut
LIMIT valeur
```
