# Cypher

Cypher is [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) Graph Query Language.
You can find the [tutorial here](cyhper/index.md)

About Cypher

* **needs register :(**
* cloud or local databases
* [open-source](https://github.com/neo4j)
* the syntax looks like SQL
* easy to learn but it's easy to make
  a mistake in your query
  (at least way more than in MongoDB for instance)

## MongoDB

Here is the mongoDB [tutorial](mongodb/index.md).

About mongo

* cloud or local databases
* you will use JSON to defines the data manipulated
* easy to learn, almost no syntax
* the process of referencing another object is not convenient
* it seems to be protected against injections
  (because we are using Object-relational mapping or ORM)

## RethinkDB

It's a "NoSQL database that stores schemaless JSON documents".
I haven't tried it yet but I want to keep it here 
just in case.
