# Introduction

NoSQL stands for NotOnlySQL. It's used to describe
Graph databases (GDB) that are not
relational databases but allows SQL and a new kind
of query language.

It's appeared around 2010 (but it's something existing
since 1960) and it's used by
a lot of actors like Google, Microsoft, Facebook
or Twitter.

Since 2019, the [GQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Query_Language)
(Graph Query Language) may becomes a database query language
like the SQL but it seems they are still working on it.

There is a lot of kind of NoSQL database as of now,

* [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a "document" kind of database
* [cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) is a "nodes and edges" kind of database

## MongoDB

Here is the mongoDB [tutorial](mongodb/index.md).

About mongo

* you will use JSON to defines the data manipulated
* easy to learn, almost no syntax
* the process of referencing another object is not convenient
* it seems to be protected against injections
  (because we are using Object-relational mapping or ORM)
