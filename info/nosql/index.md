# Introduction

**NoSQL** stands for **NotOnlySQL**. It's used to describe databases that are **not relational databases**, but **allows SQL** and **a new kind of query language**. It's appeared around **2010** <small>(but it's something existing since **1960**)</small>, and it's used by a lot of actors like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or Twitter.

We got 4 kinds of NoSQL databases models

* **Key-value**: a key is associated to a value
* **Document**: data stored as documents, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* **Columnar**: using a key-columns where column is a bunch of values
* **Graph**: nodes and edges, [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/)

> **Note**: Since 2019, the [GQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Query_Language) (Graph Query Language) may becomes a database query language for Graph databases (GDB) like the SQL for relational databases, but it seems they are still working on it.
