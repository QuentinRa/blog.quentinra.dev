# Introduction

An application programming interface (API) is an interface 
allowing an user to use someone else services without
digging into the code.

The most well-know usage of API are "bank API" that
are allowing a website to process payments. They do
not know how the API is internal working but they
are calling some functions and now they can add
payments to their websites. The advantage is that
the API is developed and maintained by someone else
so they are the ones responsible to fix anything related
to the API.

Developers are also developing API because it's
easier to code this way like once you created your
API for your website, you can create a mobile app,
a desktop app, ... without having to rewrite
the code to access the database (for instance)
and if you found a bug, then you only need to patch
the API.
