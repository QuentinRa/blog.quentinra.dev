"three-way handshake": SYN (synchronise) SYN/ACK ACK (Acknowledgement)
ACK number

Sequence Number	When a connection occurs, the first piece of data transmitted is given a random number.
Acknowledgement Number	After a piece of data has been given a sequence number, the number for the next piece of data will
have the sequence number + 1.

>> UDP
stateless

>> Port-forwarding
port forwarding opens specific ports

Stateless: check packet
Stateful: check connection

>> VPN
A Virtual Private Network (or VPN for short) is a technology that allows devices on separate networks to
communicate securely by creating a dedicated path between each other over the Internet (known as a tunnel).
Devices connected within this tunnel form their own private network.
=> PPP (internal VPNs using public/private key)
=> PPTP use PPP, Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol, allow leave network
=> IPSec Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) encrypts data using the existing Internet Protocol (IP) framework.

Router: Layer3 (use IP)
Switch: Layer2 (use MAC)
Switch: Layer3 (use MAC/IP): can do routing
A technology called VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) allows specific devices within a network
to be virtually split up. This split means they can all benefit from things such as an Internet
connection but are treated separately. This network separation provides security because it means
that rules in place determine how specific devices communicate with each other.
This segregation is illustrated in the diagram below:

>> Session
the session layer will begin to divide up the data sent into smaller chunks of data and begin to send these chunks (packets) one at a time.
This dividing up is beneficial because if the connection is lost, only the chunks that weren't yet sent will have to be sent again

=> Network
Whilst some protocols at this layer determine exactly what is the "optimal" path that data should take to reach a device,
we should only know about their existence at this stage of the networking module. Briefly, these protocols include OSPF
(Open Shortest Path First) and RIP (Routing Information Protocol). The factors that decide what route is taken is decided by the following:

What path is the shortest? I.e. has the least amount of devices that the packet needs to travel across.
What path is the most reliable? I.e. have packets been lost on that path before?
Which path has the faster physical connection? I.e. is one path using a copper connection (slower) or a fibre (considerably faster)?

A packet without the IP is called frame.
