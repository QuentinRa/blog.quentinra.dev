>> Session
the session layer will begin to divide up the data sent into smaller chunks of data and begin to send these chunks (packets) one at a time.
This dividing up is beneficial because if the connection is lost, only the chunks that weren't yet sent will have to be sent again

=> Network
Whilst some protocols at this layer determine exactly what is the "optimal" path that data should take to reach a device,
we should only know about their existence at this stage of the networking module. Briefly, these protocols include OSPF
(Open Shortest Path First) and RIP (Routing Information Protocol). The factors that decide what route is taken is decided by the following:

What path is the shortest? I.e. has the least amount of devices that the packet needs to travel across.
What path is the most reliable? I.e. have packets been lost on that path before?
Which path has the faster physical connection? I.e. is one path using a copper connection (slower) or a fibre (considerably faster)?
