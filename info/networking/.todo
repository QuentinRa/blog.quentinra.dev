A network is a net of things connected to each other. What we refer to "The Internet" are many small networks all joined together.

A communication between two machines implies

* an IP address to identify the network, and the machine outside the network (logical identifier)
* a MAC address, to identify the current owner of an IP address (physical identifier)
* a port, that is "where" the communication will pass by on a machine
* a protocol, which is "how" the communication will be handled
