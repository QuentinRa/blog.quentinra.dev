# PHP

PHP is a language to run some code before sending a
web page. You have a lot of things not available in HTML
such as

* **statements**: loops, if, ...
* **functions**: you can create function or use them
in order to factorize some code, change some values
on your page (dates, translations, ...) etc.
* **server-side code**: when submitting a form, uploading
a file, ... you need your web server to handle it.
* **sessions**: you can store some data so that your
website remember that you are logged in what
we call a session.
  
PHP isn't the only way to do that, some developers are now using
JS with Node.js for example to handle the server-side logic.

## Setup

In order to run some php code, you first need a server. Some
developers are directly coding a the server, or in 
other word they are coding, sending file to the server
then check the website. That's not a good practice...

* You can setup a [(virtual) local server](setup/wamp.md)
* You can setup a [apache server on linux](setup/apache.md)
* use some IDE! For instance, I know that
[PHPStorm](../../tools/jetbrains/phpstorm/remote.md)
allow you to create a remote project and is automatically
uploading changes on the server (paid but free
if you register with your student email). Check out
if your IDE is doing it!
