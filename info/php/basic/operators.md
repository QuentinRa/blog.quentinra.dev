# Operators

[Go back](..)

Usual operators

* ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``
* ``+=``, ``-=``, ``*=``, ``/=``
* ``**`` (power)
* ``%`` (mod)
* ``.`` (concatenation)
* ``>``, ``>=``, ``<=``, ``<``
* ``=`` (assign)

But to test equality, or difference, you can choose
whether matter (strict) or not.

* (strict) : ``===`` or `!==`
* (non strict) : ``==`` or `!=`/`<>`

> Note that this statement ``0 == 'true' && 0 == 'false'``
> is **TRUE** in PHP so use strict equality if you don't
> know what to use.
