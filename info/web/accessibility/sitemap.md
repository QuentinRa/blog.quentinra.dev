# Sitemap

[Go back](../index.md#websites-improvements-summary)

First and foremost, a sitemap is not needed by looking
at the link on each page, we can make a graph of your website.
You may add one to index images, videos, ... but it looks
meaningless to me. Another use of a sitemap is ranking
the page of your website (with a score from 0 to 1).

Anyways, have a sitemap, a XML mapping your website
can't be a bad thing. You may create one using

* <https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/> (max. 500 pages)
* <https://www.sitemapgenie.com/> (no limit or it seems so)
* you can find some tools on github

Once you created your sitemap, simply send it
to google or any search engine you want.
