# CDN

[Go back](../index.md#websites-improvements-summary)

You can make your website faster, using Content delivery network (CDN). You can even use one for **free**, as I'm doing with this website.

* [jsdeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
  * free
  * for a file hosted on GitHub, simply submit the URL `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo/path/to/file.png`
* [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/)
  * free
  * but you need to submit an issue to add your repository (not tested)
* [gitcdn](https://github.com/schme16/gitcdn.xyz)
  * free
  * same as jsdeliver, but slower (ðŸ™„)
* [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/)
  * not tested
  * seems free
