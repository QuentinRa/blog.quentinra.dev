# robots.txt

[Go back](../index.md#websites-improvements-summary)

This is one of the files that robots are checking
when they visit your website.

You may create a robots.txt (<http://robots-txt.com/>)
to exclude some pages in the search/disallow some bots
but that's not because you create this file that
robots will listen.
