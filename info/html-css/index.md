# HTML and CSS

Here you will learn how you can create a basic website,
in HTML and add some style using CSS. You may check
PHP course to handle the server logic (explained later)
or JS (can also handle server logic, mainly used to run
some code in the client browser).

Just so you know, learning the web starts 
at [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
so be sure to check their tutorials.

## Introduction

When you write some URL in your browser, you 
made a request like ``https://duckduckgo.com/`` to a
server. The server returns to you a make page, written
in ``HTML``.

You can write some ``index.html`` file with this
inside, then drag and drop it into your browser
and you got a page!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
        <title>website title</title>
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
    <!-- code -->
    <h1>A big title here</h1>
    <p>Some text here</p>
</body>
</html>
```
