# Procedural Language

**PL/SQL** (Procedural Language for SQL), or **PL/pgSQL** (for PostgreSQL) are extensions of the SQL, allowing you to run code in your database. There is some small differences between the procedural language in Oracle, and the procedural language in PostgreSQL, but aside from that, almost everything is the same üëç.

<hr class="sl">

## PL/SQL (Oracle) - particularities

```sql
-- enable output, only done once, off by default
set serveroutput on
-- print something
dbms_output.put_line('something'); 
```
```sql
-- show more information about your errors (need to be called multiples times)
show errors;
-- raise an exception
exception_name EXCEPTION;
PRAGMA exception_init(exception_name, code);
raise_application_error(code, "message");
```

You need to add a `/` after `END` to compile your code.

<details>
<summary>Procedures üôÑ</summary>

This is a sort of function, with some small differences (no return, parameters OUT, cannot be called in SQL, ...).

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE
procedure_name(name1 type, name2 type) IS
-- variables
BEGIN
-- code
END;
/ -- compile

-- call (one of these)
execute procedure_name(args);
call procedure_name(args);
```
</details>

<hr class="sr">

## PL/pgSQL (PostgreSQL) - particularities

```sql
-- print something
RAISE NOTICE 'something';
RAISE NOTICE 'Some message with a parameter: %', 5;
RAISE NOTICE '... % ... % ...', 5, 7;
```

<hr class="sl">

## Block of code

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mx-0"><div>

```sql
DECLARE
-- declare variables
BEGIN
-- instructions
-- COMMIT or ROLLBACK
EXCEPTION
-- handle exceptions
END;
```
</div><div class="align-self-center">

* **DECLARE** is optional. If you got variables, it's one per line, with a semi-colon at end end of each line.
* **BEGIN** is the code itself

**Take noteü§ö!** If you are doing a DML statement (INSERT, UPDATE, ...), then you must **COMMIT** (=save) or **ROLLBACK** (=cancel).

* **EXCEPTION** is optional. You will handle exceptional behaviors (ex: errors) here.
</div></div>

<hr class="sr">

## Declare variables

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mx-0"><div>

We need variables, either **to store the result of a SQL request**, or because we are a good fellow, and **declare constants** instead of using hard coded values ü§Æ.

The syntax is the following <small>([a] means that "a" is optional)</small>

```none
v_name [CONSTANT] type [NOT NULL] [ := expression ]
```

> **Pro tip üöÄ**: we are adding a `v_` to make it explicit in the name, that this is a variable. It could be a parameter too (if we are inside a function/...).<br>
> **Pro tip**: you can create types with `CREATE TYPE`.
</div><div class="align-center">

**Examples**

```sql
-- constant
v_five CONSTANT integer := 5;
-- not null
v_real real NOT NULL := 3.0;
-- simple variable
v_date date;
-- array
v_array int array[3] := '{0,1,2}';
```
</div></div>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Inter types üòé</summary>

You may want your variable to not take an hardcoded type, but a type from an attribute

```sql
v_name table.attr%type; -- type of the attribute "attr" in "table"
v_name_copy v_name%type; -- type of the variable v_name
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Records/Tuples üëå</summary>

If you got such a request, returning only one record. Then we got a type for this

```sql
Select * from some_table LIMIT 0, 1
```

In PL/SQL, you can do this. Note that you can access an attribute of a record with `.` (dot).

```sql
v_record record; -- record/tuple
v_record table%ROWTYPE; -- store a record/tuple of a table "table"
```
</details>

<hr class="sl">

## Statements

<details class="details-e">
<summary>IF and CASE (switch)</summary>

```sql
IF something THEN [ELSIF condition THEN]
	[ELSE condition THEN]
END IF;

-- if(){} else if(){} ...
CASE variable
	WHEN valeur THEN instruction
	WHEN valeur THEN instruction
	ELSE instruction
END CASE;
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Loop (do while) and while</summary>

```sql
-- do ... while
LOOP something
	EXIT WHEN condition
END LOOP;

-- while
WHILE something LOOP some_code END LOOP;
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>For statement</summary>

```sql
-- for i in seq / for (i=min; i<max; i++){}
FOR i IN min AND max LOOP some_code END LOOP;
-- reverse loop
FOR i IN REVERSE min AND max LOOP some_code END LOOP;
```
</details>

## Exceptions

An exception is a signal. Most of the time, it's raised because an error happened. You can handle it in the bloc exception, but if you didn't, then the signal will be send upward (=to the caller). If we are back on the request, then the request is crashing with an error.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mx-0"><div>

**You can raise an exception** with `RAISE`

```sql
RAISE 'same as raise notice format' [, values]
RAISE '...' USING ERRCODE = 'error_code'
RAISE SOME_EXCEPTION
RAISE SOME_EXCEPTION USING MESSAGE = 'additional message'
```

Some examples

```sql
RAISE 'Error: no records matching id=%', id;
RAISE DIVISION_BY_ZERO;
```
</div><div>

**You can catch an exception**, in `EXCEPTION` with `WHEN`. You can make multiples WHEN in EXCEPTION.

```sql
WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN some_code;
WHEN DIVISION_BY_ZERO THEN some_code; -- ZERO_DIVIDE in Oracle
WHEN UNIQUE_VIOLATION THEN some_code;
-- you tried a select into, with a request
-- returning more than one row.
WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN some_code;
-- every exception, fallback
WHEN OTHERS THEN some_code;
```
</div></div>

You got a lot of predefined exceptions, check your database documentation.

<hr class="sr">

## Functions

A function is a bloc of code, that may take parameters, and return something.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mx-0"><div>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION name(args) 
RETURNS r_type AS $$
-- declare ...
BEGIN
    -- code ...
    [RETURN result;]
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
</div><div class="align-self-center">

* **name** is obviously the name of our function
* **args** are the argument, with `name type` for each argument.
* **r_type** is the return type, such as `VOID`, `INT`, etc.
* You can call DECLARE, then write your code inside BEGIN-END
* **RETURN** is returning the result of your function (if the return type isn't void).
</div></div>

> **Note**: if you add something inside `$$`, make sure the content is matching the second delimiter `$$`.<br>
> **Pro tip**: you can use `$1`, ... instead of the name of the arguments.

<hr class="sl">

## Triggers

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mx-0"><div>

A trigger (`d√©clencheur`) is a function that will be triggered on an event, such as inserting, updating or deleting an element. You could use it to calculate derived fields, or to archive deleted records.

```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE /* or AFTER */ some_event ON some_table
[FOR EACH ROW]
[WHEN some_condition]
-- some code (ex: BEGIN ... END)
-- or
-- EXECUTE PROCEDURE function(args);
```
</div><div class="align-self-center">

A trigger is executed either **BEFORE** or **AFTER** an event, such as **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ...**. You may set a trigger only on **one column** using `UPDATE(column)` or `UPDATE OF column`.

Add **OR REPLACE** if you are updating an existing trigger.

* **FOR EACH ROW**: If you are planning to update every row, then add it. This may be the case, if the grade of each person is based on the median. If a grade change, we need to update every grade.

* **WHEN**: You may add a when clause. If the condition is false, then the trigger is not triggered for this record.

> **Pro tip**: you can make a trigger for multiples events, with `OR` such as `INSERT OR UPDATE`.<br>
</div></div>

A function called by a trigger isn't a normal function. Aside from the two variables **NEW** and **OLD**, **you will have to return** (type = TRIGGER)

* `NULL`: cancel insert/update/delete
* `NEW`/`OLD`/...: the new record
* If you omit RETURN, then its the same as `RETURN NEW`

**Vocabulary** üòé

* **Trigger DML**: executed on every record that triggered the event
* **Trigger DML line**: executed once per event
* **Trigger DDL** (`Trigger base/sch√©ma`): executed once

> **Pro tip**: no COMMIT/ROLLBACK in a trigger, as the request will already do once.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>OLD and NEW ‚ú®</summary>

When updating a line, you got the old record in `OLD`, the one after updating in `NEW`. For an insert, you got only `NEW` (OLD is null). For a delete, you got only `OLD` (NEW is null).

You will most likely use them inside your trigger ‚ú®. They are called **correlation variables**. They are records, such use `.` to get an attribute.

Sometimes, we are renaming them. Right before the `FOR EACH ROW` (even if you don't have one), you could do this, to use `:old` and `:new`.

```sql
REFERENCING OLD :old NEW :new
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Delete a trigger</summary>

```sql
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name ON some_table;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name ON some_table;
```
</details>

<hr class="sr">

## Some templates

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Function</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function(param1 INTEGER, param2 INTEGER) RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'param1 is %. param2 is %.', param1, param2;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Then test

```sql
SELECT some_function(5,10);
-- [...] param1 is 5. param2 is 10.
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Catch an exception</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function() RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    Select 1/0;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN division_by_zero then RAISE EXCEPTION 'catch';
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Select into</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function() RETURNS RECORD AS $$
DECLARE
    v_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    Select 1, 'Luna', 18, 'Woman' INTO v_record;
    RETURN v_record;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Then test

```sql
SELECT some_function()
-- (1,Luna,18,Woman)
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Using a cursor</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function() RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
v_cursor CURSOR IS SELECT 'Luna' as NAME; -- some real request üôÑ
v_entry RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR v_entry IN v_cursor LOOP
        -- do something
        -- raise exception :)
        RAISE '%', v_entry.name;
	END LOOP;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

```sql
SELECT some_function();
-- [...] Luna
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Triggers</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN NEW; -- 
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

You should check if "BEFORE INSERT" is what you want, and if you should remove "FOR EACH ROW"...

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER some_trigger BEFORE INSERT ON some_table FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE some_function();
```
