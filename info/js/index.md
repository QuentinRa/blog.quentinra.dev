# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) base is made of the scripting language ECMAScript. We are currently in **ECMAScript2021** (v12). The most used version of JavaScript is **ECMAScript6** (2015). In the ancient times, JQuery was a popular library adding a lot of useful stuffs in Javascript, but now quite a lot of these are directly served in Javascript, so modern developers aren't using as often as before <span class="tms">(because removing it makes the website faster, increasing both performances and SEO)</span>. For instance, Boostrap (the famous CSS framework) removed the jQuery dependency in version 5 <span class="tms">(dropping Internet explorer support in the meantime)</span>.

* How to validate a form (errors, autocompletion, ...)
* Handling events (clicks, show/hide something, ...)

* How to use Web APIs (Ajax, promises, ...)
* My list of Javascript libraries

As always, you may learn JavaScript on [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/default.asp) or [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction). But, maybe those two may be worth a go [javascript.com](https://www.javascript.com/learn/strings) and [javascript tutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/).

> **Note**: As you may have seen in the CSS course, instead of writing JavaScript, you can write **TypeScript** (sort of enhanced JavaScript) and **compile it in any version of JavaScript**.

## Introduction

<table class="table border-dark table-striped table-bordered">
<thead><tr><th>Inline JS ü§Æ</th><th>SCRIPT tag ü§¢</th><th>External JS üòç</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

You can write JavaScript directly inside a component using attributes such as `onmouseover`, `onclick`, `onsubmit` etc.
```HTML
<p onmouseover="console.log('some code')">
    ...
</p>
```
</td>
<td>

You can use one (or more) tag &lt;script&gt;, and put the JS inside.

```HTML
<script>
console.log('some code')
</script>
```
</td>
<td>

You can write JS in an external write, and link it to the HTML with

```html
<script src="/path/to/file.js"></script>
```

Same as I told you for CSS, this is the proper way to do (allows the use of CDN, JS in one place, etc.).

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As you should have learned by now, you can see the JavaScript inside the console (Web course). You can either log using the console (üëç) or using popups (üëé)

```js
console.log("message")
console.error("error message")
console.warn("warning message")
console.info("message")
// or you can use a popup (as we did a long time ago)
alert('message')
```

## Basic Syntax

* [Variables](syntax/var.md)
* [Types](syntax/types.md)
* [Operators](syntax/operators.md)
* [Structures](syntax/structures.md)
* [Functions](syntax/function.md)

You should use ``console.log`` to print
something (in the console) like this

```js
let text = "text";
console.log(text)
console.log("text")
// others
console.error("text")
console.warn("text")
console.info("text")
```

**BEWARE**: sometimes you wrote some Javascript, go back
to your page, F5, and then you don't see any changes
(or your script isn't working). This may happens because
your CSS/JS got cached by your browser so try updating
the cache with 

* CTRL+SHIFT+F5
* CTRL+F5
* CTRL+R
* CTRL+SHIFT+R

## Advanced syntax

You may use this, but the basic syntax is enough
if you are starting JavaScript, you may come back
later if you are motivated.

* [Exceptions](syntax/exceptions.md)
* [Classes and objects](syntax/classes.md)
* [Spread syntax](syntax/spread.md)

## JS for websites

We are calling DOM the Document Object Model. This is your
whole website, the tags are making a graph called a tree
and the whole graph is called the DOM. You will use
a variable called `document` (shortcut of ``window.document``)
and call functions.

* [document](web/document.md)
* [window](web/window.md)
* [forms](web/forms.md)
* [events](web/events.md)
