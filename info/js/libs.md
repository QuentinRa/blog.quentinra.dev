# JS libraries

This page is supposed to index a lot of Javascript libraries
that you may use inside a website.

## Title

With [anime.js](https://animejs.com/)
you do something like [this](https://codepen.io/mellis84/pen/JpVZNw)

<div style="width: 500px;">

![](title/handmade-title.gif)
</div>

You can use [Typed.js](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/)
to get almost the same but you can write in a terminal
in Typed.

You can find a lot of simple animations
[here](https://animate.style/).

## Background

You can use a video as your page background
with [bideo](https://rishabhp.github.io/bideo.js/).

You can add particles in the background
of your pages with [particles](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/).

Some animations [here](https://greensock.com/) are quite
beautiful.

## UI

Create carrousels easily with
[slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).

You can create a sort of image flipper
with [preloadjs](https://www.createjs.com/demos/preloadjs/preloadimages)

You can make a loooooot of funny animations with
[anime.js](https://codepen.io/collection/XLebem/?grid_type).

You can use [Turn.js](http://turnjs.com/) to make
a book with flippable pages but I didn't like it.
[StPageFlip](https://nodlik.github.io/StPageFlip/)
seems better. [PDF.js](http://www.page-flip.info/newspaper_wp/pdf-flipbook/#book_pdf/13)
is beautiful too.

## Plots

[d3.js](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/index.html)
is the most well-know library.
