# Introduction

This course will introduce **Node.js**,

* creating an API using **Node.js**
* using **WebSockets** with **socket.io**
* using **electron** to write **applications**
* and maybe using **discord.js**

Also, you may use **Node.js** with PHP or instead
of PHP to handle the server-side logic. I think the
main difference is that after sending the page to the
client, you can continue interacting with the page
in Node. This won't be covered for now.
