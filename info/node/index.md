# Introduction

This course will introduce **Node.js**,

* creating an API using **Node.js**
* using **WebSockets** with **socket.io**
* using **electron** to write **applications**
* and maybe using **discord.js**

Also, you may use **Node.js** with PHP or instead
of PHP to handle the server-side logic. I think the
main difference is that after sending the page to the
client, you can continue interacting with the page
in Node. This won't be covered for now.

## Installation

You must install Node and a package manager. I'm using
**npm**.

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* you may look at [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install both

Run ``node -v`` and `npm -v` if you want to check if
your installation is successful.
