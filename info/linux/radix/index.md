# Radix/Bases (`bases`)

This is more of a mathematical course, but you will use binaries, octal, hexadecimal numbers everywhere, as they are used by Linux. This course is about radix (`bases`), especially binaries (radix-2), octal (radix-8), decimal (radix-10), and hexadecimal (radix-16), along with how Linux is handling signed, and unsigned integers, and floating numbers.

* In a $radix-n$, values goes from $0$ to $n-1$
* After 9, we are using letters
* Radix-35 is the greatest radix we can have <small>(from 0 to Z)</small>
