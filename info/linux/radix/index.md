# Radix/Bases (`bases`)

This is more of a mathematical course, but you will use binaries, octal, hexadecimal numbers everywhere, as they are used by Linux. This course is about radix (`bases`), especially binaries (base 2), octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16), along with how Linux is handling signed, and unsigned integers, and floating numbers.
