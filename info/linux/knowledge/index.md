# General knowledge

This course is a gathering of general knowledge shared between most, if not all, Linux-based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux... Most of Linux-based distributions are free, open-source, light, secure, and performant. As the source-code is exposed, anyone can improve it, modify, and know how the underlying system is doing its job.
