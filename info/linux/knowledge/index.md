# Operating System

This course is a gathering of general knowledge shared between most, if not all, Linux-based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux... Most of Linux-based distributions are free, open-source, light, secure, and performant. As the source-code is exposed, anyone can improve it, modify, and know how the underlying system is doing its job.

> **Note**: as of now, Linux-based distributions will be referred as Linux.

## Terminal

Linux in its simplest form is a **terminal** (console, `invite de commande`). Inside a terminal, we can write commands interpreted by something called **Shell**. There are multiple Shell languages that we can use <small>(sh, csh, tcsh, ksh, bash)</small>, but **most Linux distribution are using bash** <small>(bourne again shell)</small>, an improved version of sh.

Later, or in any other course, you may find commands introduced with "something" before the command. **THIS IS NOT A PART OF THE COMMAND**, but a token that indicates where we can execute the command.

```shell
$ some_command_working_everywhere
sh > some_command_at_least_work_in_sh
bash > some_command_at_least_work_in_bash
```
