# Operating System

This course is a gathering of general knowledge shared between most, if not all, Linux-based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux... Most of Linux-based distributions are free, open-source, light, secure, and performant. As the source-code is exposed, anyone can improve it, modify, and know how the underlying system is doing its job.

> **Note**: as of now, Linux-based distributions will be referred as Linux.

There are multiple languages that we can use <small>(sh, csh, tcsh, ksh, bash)</small>, but **most Linux distribution are using bash** <small>(bourne again shell)</small>, an improved version of sh.
