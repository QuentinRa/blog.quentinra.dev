# Linux

Linux is an operating system, on which a lot of distributions such as Debian, Arch Linux, Fedora, Ubuntu, and so on... are based. I'm not an expert, so in this course, you will only learn the basics.

You might ask yourself, why are we learning this? Why are we using Linux? From my understanding, Linux is fast, free, open-source/customizable, and reliable. That's why most are installing a Linux-based OS on their servers. It means that as a user, you need to learn how to use the command line.

> **This course will refer to Windows a lot, as we are expecting readers to know Windows**.

## Console

The console (also called terminal/shell/`Ã¬nvite de commande`) may be the only way for you to interact with your Linux OS. This console may use a language such as **sh**, csh, tesh, ksh, **bash**, ... Most are using **Bash**, which is based on **sh**.

Notes

* your are writing commands right after the `$`
* press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to execute a command
* press <kbd>CTRL-C</kbd> to cancel a command
* press <kbd>CTRL-D</kbd> to end the input of a command waiting for input

Usually, when writing a command in a tutorial, we are doing one of these. For instance, for the command `ls`, we may write

* `$ ls`: run the command in any kind of shell (sh/bash/...)
* `sh> ls`: run the command in a sh console
* `# ls`: the command must be run with a **privileged** user
