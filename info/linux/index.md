# Linux

Linux is an operating system, on which a lot of distributions such as Debian, Arch Linux, Fedora, Ubuntu, and so on... are based. I'm not an expert, so in this course, you will only learn the basics.

You might ask yourself, why are we learning this? Why are we using Linux? From my understanding, Linux is fast, free, open-source/customizable, and reliable. That's why most are installing a Linux-based OS on their servers. It means that as a user, you need to learn how to use the command line.
