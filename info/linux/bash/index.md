# Bash

This course will introduce bash-specific knowledge that should help you write simpler, and maybe better code/commands, using some enhancements introduced with Bash. Note that the features introduced here shouldn't work on every machine, as they will most likely not use bash <small>(zsh. ash, csh, ksh..)</small>.
