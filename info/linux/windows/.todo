<summary>OCaml in IntelliJ (Cygwin)<br>
👍: easy setup, Makefile<br> 👎: same as WSL</summary>

Download [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html).

* Next
* Install from the internet, Next
* Next, Next, Next
* Pick a link in the list, Next
* In view, select full

Now, you have to pick the **commands** you want, which means replacing "Skip" (in the column "New") with a version of the command. You should use the search bar.
I picked **make**, **ocaml**, opam (not required), **vim** (just in case), **wget** and **curl**. If you are planning to use opam, add `libclang` and `mingw[...]clang`.

* Then process with the installation

Now, you should open a new terminal on Windows (ex: Powershell, cmd, ...) and write a command

```bash
$ make -v
# GNU Make 4.3
# ...
```

You may have to restart your IDE (if you are using one), or your computer. If this is still not working, check that `C:/cygwin64/bin` is in the PATH.

> Now you can write a Makefile in IntelliJ, and compile using Make.
