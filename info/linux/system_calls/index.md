# System calls

System calls are low-level functions that are directly interacting with the Linux kernel. You would usually use them in assembly, but this will be explained in another course. Rather, this course will focus on system calls in C, as this is hopefully simpler to learn than assembly.

> System functions are defined in `man 2`, such as `man 2 open`.<br>
> You will find inside **imports**, and **signatures** of the system calls.
