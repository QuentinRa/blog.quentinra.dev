## Introduction

Java is a oriented-object language, excluding 8 primitives types,
all other types are classes and their instances are objects.

Java is compiled using a JDK with the ``javac`` command and
is run using a JDK/JRE with the ``java`` command. JAVA is run
on a virtual machine so your code will work on any OS, trough
there may be some changes.

You got a lot of tutorials on the web as how you can install java
but theses links to download a JDK might help. Still IDE like
IntelliJ are downloading any version of Java you want when creating
a project so no install required. **We are currently in Java16
or Java1.16**

* [Open JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/)

## Vocabulary

First of all, **a class** is a container representing something
like a Computer, an Animal, a Person... A class can have properties
called **attributes** like a name, a size, ... and **methods**
like ``buy(xxxxxx)``, `remove(xxxx)` that are basically functions
applied on a class.
