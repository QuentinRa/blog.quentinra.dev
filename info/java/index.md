# Presentation of the course

In this course, you will find

* an introduction to `JAVA`
* a presentation of advanced concepts such as `Networking`, `Threads` or `Databases`.
* graphical interfaces with `AWT` or `Swing`
* modern interfaces with `JavaFX`
* some secrets things about `Java`
* how to package and create a `.exe`/`installer` for your applications

## Introduction

Java is a oriented-object language, excluding 8 primitives types,
all other types are classes and their instances are objects.

Java is compiled using a JDK with the ``javac`` command and
is run using a JDK/JRE with the ``java`` command. JAVA is run
on a virtual machine so your code will work on any OS, trough
there may be some changes.

You got a lot of tutorials on the web as how you can install java
but theses links to download a JDK might help. Still IDE like
IntelliJ are downloading any version of Java you want when creating
a project so no install required. **We are currently in Java16
or Java1.16**

* [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* [Oracle JDK (no login)](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)
* [Open JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/)
* [Windows JDK8 / 11](https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild)

## Vocabulary

First of all, **a class** is a container representing something
like a Computer, an Animal, a Person... A class can have properties
called **attributes** like a name, a size, ... and **methods**
like ``buy(xxxxxx)``, `remove(xxxx)` that are basically functions
applied on a class.

* [First java file](structure/main.md)
* [Creating a class](structure/class.md)
* [Visibility](structure/visiblity.md)
* [Attributes](structure/attributes.md)
* [Class and instance](structure/class-instance.md)
* [Methods](structure/methods.md)
* [Constructors](structure/constructors.md)
* [Creating objects](structure/creation.md)
* [Destroying objects](structure/destroy.md)

And now you should be able

* to create a file with a class
* with some attributes and some methods
* and creating some objects using constructors

Still a lot to learn but that's the must you need to know in order
to understand everything else. **You should practice by yourself
but [here](structure/mcq.md) some MCQ**.

## Beginner

Now our aim would be to write some code. But for that we
need to take a look at all of theses

* Types
* Structures
* Operators
* Object class
* Arrays
* Exceptions

Then you can read theses

* Inheritance
* Abstract classes
* Interfaces
* Javadoc
* Packages
