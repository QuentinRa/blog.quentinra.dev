# Tips

These are tips that I received to improve my code.

## Close streams

When you are reading a file (or any kind of stream),
it's normal to close it, right? But was I was forgetting
was that since I was using 1 try-catch for everything,
the stream wasn't closed if we got a reading exception.
Either use 3 (or more) try-catch or use a try-with-resources
(closed automatically)

```java
// try-with-resources
try (FileReader reader = new FileReader(file)) {
    // ...
}
```

## Static attributes change

It wasn't recommended updating a static field without
using a synchronized static method so you
must replace

```java
Class.attribute = value;
// by
Class.setAttribute(value);
// and
public synchronized static void setAttribute( /* ... */ ) { /* ... */ }
```

## Static method call with inheritance

Let's says you got a method declared in a class A,
and a class B inheriting A. Then for static methods,
do not call ``B.method()`` if the method is declared
in A.

The reason that was given to my is that It may confuse others
and create an illusion that two static members are existing.
