# Types

[Go back](..)

Java have 8 primitives types:

* **boolean**: true/false
* **byte**: 8 bits
* **short**: 16 bits
* **char**: **16 bits**, a character such as ``'5'``
* **int**: 32bits, ``5``
* **float**: 32 bits, value such as ``5.0f``
* **double**: 32bits, ``5.0`` or ``5.0d``
* **long**: 64 bits

Each primitive class has a class having almost if not the same name,
for instance ``Integer`` for int. You would have methods such as

```java
// conversion string to int
int i = Integer.parseInt("13");
```

Otherwise, any other type is a class such as Integer, Object,
ArrayList, ...
