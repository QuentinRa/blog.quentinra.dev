# Special classes

[Go back](..)

Here we will summarize code related to class
declaration.

<hr class="sr">

## Inner classes

It means a class inside another class,
the class **is not static**.

```java
// outer class
public class OuterClass {
    // inner class
    public class InnerClass {}
}
```

And you can write

```java
OuterClass o = new OuterClass();
OuterClass.InnerClass i = o.new InnerClass();
```

Usually the ``InnerClass`` is private so you are
not doing that and only using it inside the OuterClass
like you would do normally (`new InnerClass()`),
but the inner class can access the current instance
attribute.

## Nested classes

It means a class inside another class. If the class is
the class **is static**.

```java
// outer class
public class OuterClass {
    // inner class
    public static class NestedClass {}
}
```

And you can write

```java
OuterClass.NestedClass n = new OuterClass.NestedClass();
```

If a nested class is ``public``, then you should
really ask yourself if you shouldn't move it to
another file.

This time you can use the instance attribute since
you don't have an instance but you can use the class
attributes inside the ``NestedClass`` since it's
a class member.

## Anonymous class

In French, it's called ``classe anonyme / locale``.
This is a class that's not properly declared in the code
but created when the program is executed.

```java
Runnable r = new Runnable(){
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // ...
    }
};
```

Runnable is an interface and I created a class and
implemented the run method "on the fly".

## Multiple classes in one file

You may see this a lot, but don't use it okay? You
may use for some tests but that's it. Be great and
use anything aside that.

```java
public class Main {
    // ...
}

class ClassA {}
class ClassB {}
```

You can only have one public class per file, but you
may have a lot of ``package``-level classes.
