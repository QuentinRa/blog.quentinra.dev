# Protect a jar

[Go back](..)

Well, first a ``jar`` is like an executable of your
java code, you can run it with
``java -jar jar-name`` or create one with
``jar cvf `name`.jar class class assets_folder ...``.

You may add a MANIFEST.MF in your jar describing it

* <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/build.html>
* <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/manifestindex.html>
* <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/defman.html>

But well once you got a jar, or someone else jar, you
can try to find the JAVA source code. That's quite possible
considering that the machine needs to understand your code
so you can't really prevent this.

The most used tools are **Obfuscators** since they will
rewrite your code using some fancy names, ... to make it
less understandable even after the code got decompiled.

But that's only something making things slower for the
curious user, It won't really help.
But some clever guys created a solution
rewriting some part of Java and providing a new JRE
(that's not really clever but that's the only way).
