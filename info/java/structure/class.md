# Creating a class

[Go back](../index.md#vocabulary)

We used this syntax to create a class.

```java
public class Main {
}
```

The form is 

* **visibility**: public
* **type of class**: class (=normal class)
* **name**: Main
* and maybe other arguments that are not present here

> **Advanced note**: a class may be declared final, meaning that this class can't have children.
> ```java
> public final class Main { }
> ```
