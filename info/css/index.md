# Introduction

CSS is mainly used to style websites. Here
you will learn how you can write some
basic CSS.

* this course may introduce SCSS and SASS
* Boostrap and any other CSS framework won't
be introduced in this course

<div class="sr"></div>

## Where do you write css ?

You should not use the first two and only
write a ``style.css`` file but it's good to know
them since they are quite used.

* [style attribute](how/attribute.md) (`style='...'`, not recommended)
* [style tag](how/tag.md) (`<style></<style>`, not recommended)
* [style file](how/file.md) (`style.css`)

<div class="sl"></div>

## Selectors

In order to apply some style to "something", you need
to defines this "something".

* [tag selector](selector/tag.md) (ex: style all "p" tags)
* [id selector](selector/id.md) (ex: style a tag with an ID)
* [class selector](selector/class.md) (ex: style a tag having this class)
* [path selector](selector/path.md) : use the three above
* [joker selector](selector/joker.md) : other kind of selector

At this point, you are ready to write some css.
