# Cascading Style Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are mainly used to style websites, and add some animations. I'm not an expert nor fond of CSS because CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap are providing most of the CSS that I need. We are currently using **CSS3**, but maybe [someday we will see CSS4](https://css4-selectors.com/status-for-css4/) introducing [new selectors](https://css4-selectors.com/selectors/) (a lot of them are already available).

* How to write CSS
* What are selectors?
* List of CSS properties that I'm using the most
* What's responsive design?

> **Note**: as you are doing in HTML, the good developer that you are üòé, you should test that your code is following the W3C standard [using this validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). You may also want to minimize your CSS (to make your page faster, as the size of the CSS will be reduced), you can do that with a [CSS minifier](https://css-minifier.com/). If you want to use a CDN, please refer to the WEB course.

> I did use it yet (please add explanations if you did here), but you can use SASS to generate CSS, which is working like TypeScript for JavaScript, or PHP to factorize HTML code. It seems useful to make themes (dark, light).

## Introduction

A CSS is a list of **rules** that are made of **selectors+properties**. For instance, you can say that every text in a paragraph (selector "p") will be red (property color=red): this is a rule. They are three ways to write CSS.

<table class="table border-dark table-striped table-bordered">
<thead><tr><th>Inline CSS ü§Æ</th><th>CSS tag ü§¢</th><th>External CSS üòç</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

Every tag in HTML got an attribute called **style**. Simply write the CSS inside.
```HTML
<p style="color:red;background: yellow;">
  ...
</p>
```
</td>
<td>

You can use one (or more) tag &lt;style&gt;, and put the CSS inside.

```HTML
<style>
p {
  color:red;
  background: yellow;
}
</style>
```
</td>
<td>

You can put the CSS in another file, write the CSS as we did in style, and link it to the HTML with

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" 
      href="/path/to/style.css">
```

This is the best way, as developers won't have to look at every file for CSS. You will also be able to use CDN to speed up your website.

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<details>
<summary>
Usually, when using an external CSS, we are calling it <code>style.css</code>, you can make one for when we want to print the page <code>print.css</code>, and/or you can have one CSS file per page.
</summary>

```css
@charset "utf-8"; /* optional */

/* a comment */
p {
  color:red;
  background: yellow;
}
```
</details>

<details class="pt-3">
<summary><b>HELP!</b> I wrote some CSS, but I don't see any changes!?</summary>

They may be three problems **1**: you didn't use the good selector, **2**: another style is overriding yours, or **3**: your page is rendering using the cached CSS. The tips we are given are

* for **1**: try using background="red" or something like that, to check that the selector is good
* for **2**: try using `!important` or check the CSS used in the developers' tools
* for **3**: <kbd>CTRL+R</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+R</kbd> or <kbd>SHIFT+F5</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL+F5</kbd>.

## Selectors

This is a list of the selectors I know of

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped border-dark">
<thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>CSS</th><th>HTML matched</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>

<!-- Tag selector -->
<tr>
<td><b>Tag selector</b><br>
Simply write the tag, you want to select.
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-css">p { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p>Some text&lt;/p></code></pre>
</td>
</tr>

<!-- ID selector -->
<tr>
<td><b>ID selector</b><br>
Each tag can have one ID, each ID is unique within a page.
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-css">#my-id { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p id="my-id">...&lt;/p></code></pre>
</td>

<!-- Class selector -->
<tr>
<td><b>Class selector</b><br>
Each tag can have one or more classes, separated by a space.<br><br>
You can match a selector having every specified classes too.<br>You can also add a tag before a class.
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-css">.name { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-css">p.one.two { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p class="name">...&lt;/p></code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p class="one two">...&lt;/p></code></pre>
</td>

<!-- Joker selector -->
<tr>
<td>

<b>Joker selector</b> üÉè<br>
I'm the only one calling it like that üò∂.<br>
You can use `*` to select everything <br> 
(ü§Æ you should use body/html instead of `*`)
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-css">* { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p>...&lt;/p>
&lt;div>...&lt;/div>
&lt;!-- .... --&gt;
</code></pre>
</td>
</tr>

<!-- Pseudo-classes -->
<tr>
<td><b>Pseudo-classes selector</b><br>

You can apply a style to something, but only the element is in a predefined state.

You got `:active`, `:checked`, `:focus`, `:disabled`, `:visited` and many more. You also got `:first-child`, `last-child`, or `:nth-child(1)` to select a child.

</td>
<td>

```css
button:hover { /* mouse over */ }
:not(p) { /* ... */ }
*:not(p) { /* same */ }
```
</td>
<td>
...
</td>
</tr>

<!-- Property/Attribute selector -->
<tr>
<td><b>Property selector</b> (or attribute selector)<br>
You can select something according to the values of its attributes.

You got <code>=</code> (equals), <code>*=</code> (contains) etc.
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-css">input[type="radio"] {
  /* ... */
}</code></pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p class="name">...&lt;/p></code></pre>
</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

And these four aren't selector, but you can use to factorize rules

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped border-dark">
<thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>CSS</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>

<!-- , -->
<tr>
<td><b>Comma</b><br>

You can apply the same rules to a bunch of selectors by separating them with a `,` (comma).
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-css">p, a { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
</td>
</tr>

<!-- > -->
<tr>
<td><b>Path</b><br>

You can make a path by separating selectors with `>` (greater than). <br>Note that `a > b` means that b is a **direct child** of a.
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-css">p > a { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
</td>
</tr>

<!-- space -->
<tr>
<td><b>Space</b><br>

You can apply a selector to elements filtered by another.<br> This is the same as **path** without the constraint of being a direct child.
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-css">p a { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
</td>
</tr>

<!-- + -->
<tr>
<td><b>Plus</b><br>

The style is applied on the first child of the selector (ex: first link inside a paragraph).
</td>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-css">p + a { /* ... */ }</code></pre>
</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

Of course, you got more of them, as you can [read here (W3Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css_selectors.asp).

<hr class="sr">

## Values

Before digging into the properties, you must learn more about the values you can give them.

<details class="details-border">
<summary>Size</summary>
<br>

* a value (`0` is the only one that should not have a unit)
* a value with a unit (`1px`, ...). The most used unit is **px** (default, pixels), but you may check **rem**, **pc**, or **vh**.
* a percent such as `100%`
* an expression resulting in a value `calc(100% - 15px)`

A lot of properties will usually take 4 values `t r b l` (respectively top-right-bottom-left). You can either use `property-top: value` (to only set the top) or a shortcut

* `padding: ALL;` (t=r=b=l=ALL)
* `padding: Y X;` (t=b=Y, r=l=X)
* `padding: U V W;` (t=l=U, r=V, b=W)
</details>

<details class="details-border">
<summary>Color</summary>
<br>

You can use

* a name (`red`, `yellow`, etc.)
* the RGB function (ex: `rgb(r, g, b)` such as `rgb(255, 0, 0)` for red)
* the RGBA function (ex: `rgba(r, g, b, a)`, with alpha the transparency)
* the HEX code (ex: `#dd4411` or `#d41`)
</details>

<details class="details-border">
<summary>Variables</summary>
<br>

You may create variables (to store a color, a value, etc.).

<pre><code class="language-css"
>/* declare */
:root { 
  --name: value;
}
/* use */
p { 
  color: var(--name);
}</code></pre>
</details>

<hr class="sl">

## CSS properties

The format is 

<pre><code class="language-css"
>selectors {
    property_name: property_value;
}</code></pre>

Notes

* write one per line üëç
* the `;` (semicolon) is optional, but add it üëç
* you may add `!important` to force a style ü§î
* the last style is applied ("*cascade*" üëà), or the last with important
* you may use the value `inherit` to inherit the value of the parent

Usually, when you are learning CSS, you will go to other websites that you like, and learn by reading how they do something. You can also ask something on Stack Overflow, or you check websites such as W3Schools/YouTube (**don't copy-paste code, usually websites are under copyright**). I think that the best way to learn CSS, is to learn the syntax, then look on the WEB each time you need something new, and learn bit by bit, as there are **too many properties**.

<details>
<summary>Others</summary>

    border-radius: 4px; /* border radius, round some button for instance */
    
    cursor: pointer; /* change cursor to "click"=pointer cursor */
    outline: none; /* for button, outline shown on focus */

    /** content is too big and the size is not enough,
    how should we handle the overflow?
     */
    overflow:hidden; /* hide */
    overflow:auto; /* show a scroll bar */

    list-style-type: none; /* change list style üòÖ */
}</code>
</pre>
</details>
<br>

This is almost everything I used, and I'm considering myself to be a beginner. You should **at least know these ones**

|Property|Effect|
|----|----|
|background| set the background (image/color/...)|
|color| set the color of the text|
|text-decoration: none;|remove the underline under a link|
|display: none;| same as the attribute hidden in HTML|
|display: flex;| Read [about flex](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp), it's wonderful üòç |
|border: size solid color;| add a border |
|padding|gap between a component, and it's border| 
|margin|gap between a component, and the "outside"|

## Responsive design

This is most likely what will take most of your time, and why I switched to Bootstrap. Your user will use different resolutions when visiting your website, different browsers, and different platforms (mobile, tablet, computer, etc.). This is your job, that the website is properly rendered on each platform, and that's a practice called **responsive design**.

The first thing to do is to add this line in your HTML, so that the website will try to adapt itself according to the size of the screen

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Then, we will write **media queries**. These are blocks in which you will declare the rules that should be used if the screen is lesser than "Xpx" or greater than "Ypx" or within "Xpx" and "Ypx".

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 950px) {
    /* the style declared here will only
     be used is the width is lesser than
     950px. */
}

@media screen and (max-width: 1100px) and (min-width: 950px) {
    /* ... */
}
```

You can use that to hide/show some buttons, change some component's positions, ...

> **edit 02/09/2021**: media queries are more complex than what I learned, you can [read more here](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/media-css#media-types), as I saw a lot of times `@media (min-width: 950px) {}` instead of the code above with `screen and`.
