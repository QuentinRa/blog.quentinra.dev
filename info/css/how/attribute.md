# Using the style attribute

[Go back](..)

First, you can write CSS directly using the ``style``
attribute of a tag.

```html
<p style="color: #FFCC33;background: grey;">
    Some text with a grey background
    in yellow.
</p>
```

<p style="color: #FFCC33;background: grey;">
    Some text with a grey background
    in yellow.
</p>

It's not a good practice but you may do it at first
because it's quite a fast method to test some style.
