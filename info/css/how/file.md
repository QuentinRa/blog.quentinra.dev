# Write a CSS file

You will create a file, usually called ``style.css``
and write some css inside.

Then you need to link the file with your HTML file, 
you do that using ``link`` tag.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

> style.css is in the same folder here, otherwise
> use a relative path
