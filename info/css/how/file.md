# Write a CSS file

[Go back](..)

You will create a file, usually called ``style.css``
and write some css inside.

Then you need to link the file with your HTML file, 
you do that using ``link`` tag.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

> style.css is in the same folder here, otherwise
> use a relative path

If you are wondering what's the first line, you should
already at it each time you create a HTML file but
that's a line telling to your browser a message like "Hey, try
to adapt the website if the screen is small" through you
will have to do a lot by yourself later, nothing will works
without this line.
