# Structured Query Language

Structured Query Language, often abbreviated **SQL** is a normalized language to process queries on a relational database. It's based on a "model" that you defined. If you need something flexible, you should look at NoSQL databases.

Relational databases are provided by a **DataBase management system DBMS** (`Syst√®me de gestion de base de donn√©es (SGBD)`). You will need one to manage your databases among

* **Oracle**
* **PostgresSQL**
* **MariaDB**
* MySQL
* SQLite
* ...

> **You need to install one**, to continue this course. Please, refer to your DBMS documentation ü§ì. A temporary solution might be to use [SQLiteOnline](https://sqliteonline.com/) (üôÑ).
> 
> **ENSIIE students** got a some notes [in the WEB section](../../special/web/parts/db-acc.md) to use our school database.

> **SQL 89/92**: Both **SQL-89** and **SQL-92** are quite used. There is one major difference: what we call "JOIN clauses" are **not available in SQL-89**.

## Relational model

In the second screen, you can see the usual representation of your data in a database. This is a literally an Exel table with rows, columns, and entries. In the first screen, this is the UML representation, that we use when creating a database from specifications (see **relational modeling**).

‚ú® **Some vocabulary** ‚ú®
 
| Element | Name (UML) | Name (DBMS) | Note |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Customer | **Class** | **Table** |  |
| id, name, age, gender | **Attributes** | **Attributes** | <small>(=columns)</small> |
| `(1, "Luna", 18, "Woman")`, ... | **Objects** | **Tuples**/Records | <small>(=rows)</small>. We are saying "tuples" in French too. |
| id | **Identifiers** <br> <small>(Keys, but this is a mistake)</small> | **Keys** | A **primary key** is a set of **one or more attributes**.<br>We can find a row in a table, given its values in the primary key.<br> The primary key as a whole is **unique** and **not-null**. <br>This is used to reference a tuple in another table (**Foreign key**).<br>Usually, we are using an **artificial key** <br>which is incrementing (+=1) each time we are adding a row.<br><small>Here, given "id=1", we know we are talking of "(1, Luna, ...)".</small> |

> Note: I know that "customer" **should starts with an uppercase**, as every class should do. I should also **add something before id** <small>(as many class may have an attribute id, so I won't have to prefix it)</small>, and I should **add something before name** <small>(as name is a **reserved keyword** otherwise, I will have to escape it later)</small> (ex: c_id, c_name).

## Zest of knowledge

> **Clause**
> 
> This is the keywords SELECT, FROM, ... that are making a SQL request.

> **Request**
> 
> This is a statement in which you are using clauses to do something on the database. **A request must ends with a `;`** <small>(unless this is a simple request)</small>.

> **Schema**
> 
> To make it simple, this is a table storing data. Some are saying this is a library of databases. To call a table in a schema, do `schema.table`.
> 
> * For an user, this is the list of its tables, views, constraints
> * For a database, this is the table **INFORMATION_SCHEMA** (TABLES, USERS, COLUMNS/DOMAINS, CHECK_CONSTRAINTS)
> 
> This word is also used for requests üßê: this is the selected tables, and the attributes.
> 
> As the ENSIIE, we got one schema per user (ex: `prenom.nom`) in which we got another schema called `public`. You will store your databases in it.

> **DML, DDL, DCL**
> 
> We are using DML/DDL/DCL, to talk about a category of clauses. This is something quite used by pros üòé.
> 
> * DML (Data Manipulation): Select, Insert, Update, Delete
> * DDL (Data Definition): Create, Alter, Drop
> * DCL (Data control): Grant, Revoke

> ‚òë‚úÖ **Primary and Foreign keys** ‚òë‚úÖ
> 
> **YOU MUST KNOW THIS**. The primary key is explained in the previous section. This is usually one attribute called "id" which is an artificial key. A **Foreign key** is a set of attributes (=keys) which are taking values from another key.
> 
> For instance, a customer(c_id, c_name, ...) will make purchases(p_id, date, description, ...). You will add in the table purchases an attribute "c_id" (the name does not matters) taking values from the table "customer". You should see this as referencing a customer inside another table.

## SQL Syntax

Before digging into the clauses, here is a list of everything that you will be supposed to known in the next sections.

<div class="row mx-0"><div class="col-6">

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM information_schema.TABLES T
WHERE T.TABLE_SCHEMA = 'information_schema';
```
</div><div class="col-6 align-self-center">

* **Clauses name are not case sensitive** <small>(uppercase, lowercase, mix of both)</small>
* **Requests end with a ;** <small>(unless they are simples)</small>
* You can put everything on the same line
</div></div>

More specifically

| Notion (General) | In SQL |
| ------ | ------- |
| Assignment <small>(PL/SQL only)</small> | `a = 5`, or `√† := 5` |
| Comments | `-- comment` (no inline comment) |
| a % b | `MOD(a,b)` |
| Reserved words | `Select date [...]` ‚ùå (date, name, ... are reserved)<br><code>Select \`date\` [...]</code> ‚úÖ |
| DAY/... from date | `EXTRACT(element from some_date)` <br>With element YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, ... |

| Notion (Strings) | In SQL |
| ------ | ------- |
| String | `'a'` or `"a"` (the latter may not work) |
| String (escape) | ex: use a quote in a quote `'\''` |
| Concatenate | <code>'a' \|\| 'b'</code> |
| Extract chars | Left(string, count) or RIGHT(string, count) |

> **Note**: More functions at [W3Schools - SQL Server Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/SQL/sql_ref_sqlserver.asp).<br>
> **Test a function?**: `SELECT EXTRACT(DAY from '2020-03-25')`

## DML (Data Manipulation)

You can see a DML request, as a request returning a table. You will define in **SELECT** the attributes of your table, in **FROM** where the tuples are selected, and in **WHERE** some restrictions on the tuples selected.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Select</summary>

<div class="row mx-0 row-cols-md-2"><div>

If I'm using `Select name FROM customer`, I will get a table with **a column "name"** and the tuples will be the values for "name" in customer <small>(I should escape name, otherwise this may not work in every DBMS)</small>.

```sql
-- Select every attribute of a table
SELECT * FROM customer;
SELECT id, name, age, gender FROM customer;

-- no duplicate results (each line once)
SELECT DISTINCT name, gender FROM customer;

-- name is renamed as 'Customer name'
SELECT name as 'Customer name', id FROM customer;
-- escape name
SELECT `name`, id FROM customer;
```
</div><div>

```sql
SELECT id as 'c_id', `name`, age FROM customer;
```

Output: ![Select SQL output](images/dml/select.png)

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 5 as 'GroupID', -- every row will have 5 
                LEFT(name, 1) as 'Letter' -- first letter only
FROM customer;
```

Output: ![Select SQL output](images/dml/select2.png)

</div></div></details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>From</summary>

You are using columns in select. But they are coming from somewhere... That's where the `FROM` come in handy. Pick the table <small>(for more than one, see JOINT clauses)</small> you want to select columns (and their values) from.

```sql
-- the basic ü§ì
SELECT * FROM customer;
-- prefix (used later WHEN NEEDED, not always)
SELECT customer.* FROM customer;
SELECT c.* FROM customer c;
SELECT c.name FROM customer c;

-- this is the cartesian product, you will get
-- count_lines(c1) * count_lines(c2) records
-- LEARN ABOUT JOINTURES LATER
SELECT * FROM customer c1, customer c2;
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Where</summary>

Most likely the most complex one. You can filter your result using this clause.

```sql
-- you can use > >= = <> (same as !=) < <=
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name <> 'Luna'; -- Henry
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name = 'Luna'; -- Luna

-- && and || are working too, but we are using AND and OR
Select name FROM customer WHERE name = 'Luna' OR gender <> 'Woman'; -- Both
Select name FROM customer WHERE name = 'Luna' AND gender <> 'Woman'; -- None

SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name IN ('Luna'); -- Luna
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name IN ('Luna', 'Henry'); -- Both
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name NOT IN ('Luna');

SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name IS NULL; -- none
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name IS NOT NULL; -- Both

-- age in [18,24], same as age >= 18 AND age <= 24
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 24;
```

You can use **Patterns** too, with `_` a unknown character, and `%` a string of unknown characters that may be empty.

```sql
-- any character followed by una
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name LIKE '_una';
-- Ending with una
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name LIKE '%una';
-- Starting with Lun
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name LIKE 'Lun%';
```

And you can used a nested request

```sql
-- you will use the variable c in the nested request.
-- if the request return one row, then EXISTS is true
SELECT name FROM customer c WHERE EXISTS (SELECT NULL);
SELECT name FROM customer c WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT NULL);

-- same as previously, but the set is generated with a request
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name IN (SELECT NULL)
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE name NOT IN (SELECT NULL)

-- the attribute is greater than every value returned in the nested request
-- the nested request must return exactly one attribute
SELECT name FROM customer c WHERE name >= ALL (SELECT NULL, NULL);
-- at least one
SELECT name FROM customer c WHERE name >= ANY (SELECT NULL)
```
</details>
