# SQL

This is a really big course, covering

* an introduction to SQL, SQL89 and SQL92
* some advanced concepts such as optimization, indexes, locks, ...
* PGSQL or PLPGSQL
* NoSQL or NotOnlySQL database with Cypher

But this course won't handles ``relational modeling``
as this is considered to be in the ``UML`` course.

## Let's start from scratch

A database is a place to store data. To store all theses data, you will need someone to manage
all of this, that's a ``DataBase Management System / DBMS``
such as

* Oracle
* MySQL
* MariaDB
* PostgreSQL
* ...

You will need to install one of those in order to continue.
If you want to do some tests, use <https://sqliteonline.com/>
and connect either to ``maria`` or `postgre`. After 15 minutes
of inactivity you will be disconnected so prefer
installing something. I personally use ``Wamp`` on `Windows`
or on a linux you can simply install ``maria`` or `postgre`.
