# OCaml

OCaml is a functional language, from the family of Meta Languages (".ml", along with SML or CAML). Unfortunately, OCaml is **impure**, as it allows side effects. It's strongly advised to read the course about **Functional programming** before starting, so you know about immutable, purity, and things like this. We are currently in [OCaml 4.14](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) <small>(OCaml 5.0 is in progress)</small>.

* [The official tutorials](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/)

> If you are into functional programming, you should check out Haskell, as there are no side effects in it.

## Introduction

...

I made some tutorials to [install OCaml on Windows/Linux/MacOS here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18531-ocaml/documentation/setup-wsl-windows). You can also use OCaml in your browser with [TryOCamlPro](https://try.ocamlpro.com/) (online REPL).

<hr class="sr">

## OCaml REPL

The OCaml Top-Level, also called the **REPL**, is something like you got in Python or Java (recently), allowing you to write commands and see the result. You can start it using the command **`ocaml`**. Every expression must end with `;;` (unlike in a `.ml`).

One thing that make the REPL useful, is that every expression is evaluated and its value is printed to the console. In other words, you won't have to call "printf", and you won't have to worry that an expression is not called (as explained below).

## OCaml and .ml files

You will usually write ocaml code in a `.ml` file, such as `main.ml`. Then, you will have to compile it using the command `ocamlc` which is working like `gcc` (in C programming).

* `ocamlc file.ml`: create a `a.out`
* `./a.out`: execute the code in "file.ml"

## Functional languages

You must declare a variable with `let`. **You can't modify a variable, you will have to create a new one** (concept of **immutability** âœ¨).

```ocaml
let x = 5
x = 6 (* NOT POSSIBLE *)
let x = 6 (* delete the old x, create a new one *)
```

In functional languages, there should be no side effects. Hence, **if you are not storing something in a variable**, **the compiler will ignore it**, something like "If I don't see you use it later, then it means that you don't need it" (concept of **purity** âœ¨). In other words, a function returning "void" such as a print is impure. Fortunately, variables starting with a `_` are not stored by the compiler, so you can use this when calling an impure function.

```ocaml
Printf.printf "%s\n" "Hello, World" (* IGNORED !!! *)

(* all of them are equivalent *)
let _ = Printf.printf "%s\n" "Hello, World"
let _ = Format.printf "%s\n" "Hello, World" (* Printf.printf is "weird", use Format *)
let _ = Format.printf "%s@." "Hello, World" (* do this one *)

(* In OCaml, "1+2" without parenthesis is considered as given 3 parameters '1' '+' '2' to a function, so add parenthesis *)
let _ = Format.printf "%d@." (1+2)
(* same for "-1" *)
let _ = Format.printf "%d@." (-1)
```

To be accurate, in OCaml **everything is a value**, so you can give "`-`" (minus) to a function, as for OCaml "`-`" is a function taking two integers and returning one integer. A function taking another function in argument is called a **higher-order function** âœ¨ (`fonction d'ordre supÃ©rieur`).

## Data structures

We are testing different ways of storing big amounts of data, along with their efficiency.

* [Binary Search Trees](data/bst.md) (`ABR`)
* [AVL trees](data/avl.md)
* [Zippers](data/zippers.md)

## Meaningless knowledge

<details class="details-border">
<summary>Comments</summary>

In OCaml, comments are not ignored, and they are really parsed... If you are writing a `"` (quote), the parser will think that you started writing a string, even if you are inside a comment. Hence, if the string is not properly finished (no matching quote), you will have an error, as you would if you wrote a non-terminated string in your code.

It can lead to surprising comments âœŒ, this one bellow (try it), is a valid comment, but most ocaml highlighters such as the one I'm using, are not parsing it properly.

```ocaml
(* "this is a string *)" *)
```

Also, in OCaml, you can have a comment inside another comment. What I mean, is that you can have a closing comment tag inside another comment... In every other language, you will see an error because the comment would be "(* (* *)", but in OCaml, the code below is working fine

```ocaml
(* (* *) *)
```
