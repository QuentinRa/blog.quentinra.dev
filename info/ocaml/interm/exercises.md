# Exercises

[Go back](../index.md#intermediary-concepts)

If you are eager to do a bunch of exercises, then here you will be able to. This is a project split into questions. Most of them are dependant on the previous ones.

The original subject, in french, [can be found here](https://github.com/memorize-code/memorize-references/raw/main/info/ocaml/IPF_projet_2021.pdf).

**It may take around 4 hours to do all of these questions**.

## Creating some types

A DNA sequence, called `brin` here in French, is a sequence of nucleotides A, C, G, and T.

Create a type for a `brin` and a type for `nucleotide`. Here is an example of a variable having the type `brin`.

```ocaml
let my_brin : brin = [A;C;G;T]
```

<blockquote class="spoiler">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml"
>type nucleotide = A | C | G | T
type brin = nucleotide list
</code></pre>

## Some useless function as a warmup (1 / 2)

Return the proportions of C and G in a brin.

```ocaml
let contenu_gc (x : brin) : float =
    (* your code here *)

contenu_gc [C;T;T;A]
(* - : float = 0.25 *)
```

<blockquote class="spoiler">
Please take note of two things, first, we don't use a fold since we have two parameters. And second, we have two accumulators since a smart guy won't use <code>List.length</code> since we are already iterating the list once so the cost would be lesser to use another accumulator for the size.

<pre><code class="language-ocaml"
>let contenu_gc (x : brin) : float =
  (* we increase the score by 1 each time we found
  a C or G. Then check the rest of the brin. If there is nothing
  more to check, then we process and evaluate the score. *)
  let rec acc (b : brin) (score : float) (size: float) = match b with
    | [] -> score /. size
    | first::other ->
        acc other
          (if (first = C || first = G) then score+.1.0 else score)
          (size +. 1.0) (* increase size, we could use List.length
                        but why would we if we already iterated the list
                        once *)
  in acc x 0.0 0.0 (* start with score=0 and size=0 *)
;;

let _ = assert((contenu_gc [A;T;G;T;T;G;A;C]) = 0.375);;
let _ = assert((contenu_gc [C;T;T;A]) = 0.25);;
let _ = assert((contenu_gc [A;A;A;T;A]) = 0.0);;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<hr class="sr">

## Some useless function as a warmup (2 / 2)

Make a function returning the complementary of a brin. You may use `List.rev` or `List.fold_left` (or `List.fold_right`).

```ocaml
let brin_complementaire (x : brin) : brin =
    (* your code here *)

brin_complementaire [C; T; A; A; T; G; T]
(* - : brin = [G; A; T; T; A; C; A] *)
```

Note that C becomes G (and G->C) and A becomes T (and T -> A).

<blockquote class="spoiler">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml"
>let brin_complementaire (x : brin) : brin =
  (*
    Invert the value of a nucleotide and
    add the result to inverted.
    Called until the inverted everything.
  *)
  let rec acc (b : brin) (inverted: brin) = match b with
    | A::other -> acc other (T::inverted)
    | T::other -> acc other (A::inverted)
    | C::other -> acc other (G::inverted)
    | G::other -> acc other (C::inverted)
    | [] -> inverted
  in List.rev (acc x []) (* reverse *)
;;
let _ = assert((brin_complementaire [T]) = [A]) ;;
let _ = assert((brin_complementaire [C; T; T; C]) = [G; A; A; G]) ;;
let _ = assert((brin_complementaire [C; T; A; A; T; G; T]) = [G; A; T; T; A; C; A]);;
</code></pre>

You may use a fold

<pre><code class="language-ocaml"
>let brin_complementaire (x : brin) : brin =
(* it's better to reverse rather than fold_right because
fold_right is not terminal*)
	List.rev (
		List.fold_left (fun inverted brin -> match brin with
		| A -> T::inverted
		| C -> G::inverted
		| G -> C::inverted
		| T -> A::inverted )
		[] x
	)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<hr class="sl">

## Distance

Make a function returning the distance between two brins. The distance is defined as the number of nucleotides that must be changed so that the brins become the same brin.

You must raise an exception if the length of the two brins are not the same.

```ocaml
let distance (x : brin) (y : brin) : int =
    (* your code here *)

distance [G; A; G] [A; G; G]
(* - : int = 2 *)
```

<blockquote class="spoiler">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml"
>let distance (x : brin) (y : brin) : int =
  let rec diff (first: brin) (second: brin) (count: int) = match first with
    | [] -> if (second = []) then count else failwith "length not the same"
    | e::other -> match second with
      | [] -> failwith "length not the same"
      | e2::other2 -> diff other other2 (if ( e2 = e ) then count else count+1)
  in diff x y 0
;;
(* test normal casses *)
let _ = assert(distance [T] [T] = 0) ;;
let _ = assert(distance [T] [C] = 1) ;;
let _ = assert(distance [G; A; G] [A; G; G] = 2);;
(* test errors *)
let _ = assert((try distance [T] [] with Failure _ -> -1) = -1) ;;
let _ = assert((try distance [] [T] with Failure _ -> -1) = -1) ;;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<hr class="sr">

## Similarity

Return the similarity between two brins. It's **one minus the distance**, then **divide** everything **by the length** <small>(of one of your two brins, as they got the same length)</small>. **You must raise an exception if the length of the two brins are not the same.**

You may use `float_of_int` to convert an integer to a float number.

```ocaml
let similarite (x : brin) (y : brin) : float =
    (* your code here *)

similarite [C;G;A;T] [T;A;G;T]
(* - : float = 0.25 *)
```

<blockquote class="spoiler">
Remember that distance already raises an exception, don't do it twice! And don't forget the conversations.

<pre><code class="language-ocaml"
>let similarite (x : brin) (y : brin) : float =
  1.0 -. (float_of_int (distance x y) /. float_of_int (List.length x))
;;
let _ = assert(similarite [C;G;A;T] [T;A;G;T] = 0.25);;
let _ = assert(similarite [A;G;C;T] [T;A;A;G] = 0.0);;
let _ = assert(similarite [A;G;C;T] [A;G;C;T] = 1.0);;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

## New type: tree

Create a new type, called `arbre_phylo` to represent a **binary** tree. Each branch have a `brin` and a malus.

<img src="/courses/info/ocaml/interm/ipf/tree.png"
alt="tree" width="500"/>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml"
>type arbre_phylo =
  (* we only have a brin for a leaf *)
  | Lf of brin
  (* a branch have two arbre_phylo (left/right), a brin and a malus *)
  | Br of arbre_phylo * brin * int * arbre_phylo
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

A malus is defined by the sum of the distances (using the function created a while back) of a node with the two children nodes.

For instance ACAT = 3 is the result of $distance(ACAT, GCAT) + distance(ACAT, TCGT) = 1 + 2 = 3.$

For AAAA, it would be $distance(AAAA, ACAT) + 3 + distance(AAAA, AAGA) + 2 = 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 8.$

## string_of_arbre_phylo

Simply write a function to print your tree.


```ocaml
let rec arbre_phylo_vers_string (a : arbre_phylo) : string =
    (* your code here *)
```

<blockquote class="spoiler">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml"
>let rec arbre_phylo_vers_string (a : arbre_phylo) : string = match a with
  (* convert a brin to string *)
  | Lf(a) -> let rec brin_vers_string (b: brin) (acc: string) : string =
               match b with

## Similarity
