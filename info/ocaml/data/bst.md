# Binary Search Trees (BST)

[Go back](../index.md#data-structures)

Binary search trees (`ABR, Arbre binaire de Recherche`) are tree with each node having up to two children. The complexity is up to $O(n)$, but in average with got a complexity of $O(h)$ with $h$ the height of the tree.

* ✅: easy to learn, and easy to implement
* ✅: faster than an ordered list for `add, remove`
* ❌: sightly slower than an ordered list for `mem`, `get_min`
* ❌: AVL trees are better
* ❌: Unless storing the cardinal, calculating it takes too much time

*The time was tested with a sample of around 5 000 000 randomly generated values in [0;10000]*.

## The main idea

A tree is made of Nodes. Each name can have up to two children. Each node is storing a value "v". If we want to add a value "e", we are following this rule

* if `e > v` then we are inserting in the right
* if `e < v` then we are inserting in the left

Simply apply this rule recursively until you can add your node.

## Add an element in a BST

<div class="mt-3">

![BST add](images/bst/add.png)
</div>

* We are adding **2** in the empty tree
* We are adding **1**: **left** (1 < 2)
* We are adding **4**: **right** (4 > 2)
* We are adding **3**: **right** (3 > 2) **left** (3 < 4)
* We are adding **5**: **right** (5 > 2) **right** (5 > 4)
* We are adding **0**: **left** (0 < 2) **left** (0 < 1)

**You mustn't add an element already in the tree**. Use an exception to exit faster your add, and returning the set (unchanged).
```ocaml
let add e set = try
	real_add_function set
with In -> set
```

## Remove an element in a BST

<div class="mt-3">

![BST add](images/bst/remove.png)
</div>

* We are removing **3**: we are taking as the new head **4** (the min in the right)
* We are removing **4**: we are taking as the new head **5** (the min in the right)
* We are removing **6**: we are taking "Empty" as the new head instead of 6 (as 6 does not have children)
* We are removing **5**: we don't have elements in our right, the new tree is made of the left

**Same as add. Use an exception to exit faster, if the element is not inside** (and return the unchanged set).
```ocaml
let remove e set = try
	real_remove_function e set
with Not_found -> set
```

## Check if an element is in a BST

* Is **2** inside? 
  * As **2** is lesser than **3**, we are checking **1**. 
  * As **2** greater than **1**, we are checking **2**.
  * Result: IN.
