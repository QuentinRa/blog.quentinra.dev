## Introduction

C++ is an extension of the C language. Everything that you could do in C, is still working in C++, but you got a whole new bunch of features.

You will write your code, meaning the **implementation** of what you declared in your headers.

```cpp
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
	// ...
}
```

You will write declarations, meaning the signatures of things <small>(functions, classes, structures, ...)</small>. You may write some code too. It seems to be a good idea to use `.hpp` instead of `.h`, [to differentiate C++ headers with C headers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/152555/h-or-hpp-for-your-class-definitions).

```cpp
#ifndef MAIN_H
#define MAIN_H

// ...

#endif //MAIN_H
```
