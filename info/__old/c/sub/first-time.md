##  For first timers

Some basics things you should know is that
in programming

* we kept values in ``variables``, and they got a `type`
* in ``C``, a number like 5 is called an `int`

We can define, like in maths, what we call ``functions``
meaning some code that will be called with ``parameters``
such as ``pow(2,5)`` where `pow` would be a function
and ``2`` and `5` are arguments.

Writing a program in ``C`` means that you will code
a function called ``main``. In this function you would
put the code to do the square of a number, if that what
you want your program to do.

We have two kind of states,

* compile
* runtime

In languages like C, you can't simply run your code. You will
need to transform it so that a machine can execute it : that's
called **compilation** and it's done by a compiler. Then, you
can call your program and It will run just fine, if there is no
errors (that's the runtime state).
