* In the screen bellow, the first value `-` indicates that this is a file. It would be `d` for a folder, `l` for a link...
* The 3 following letters `rw-` are the permissions of `u`: read+write.
* The 3 following letters `r--` are the permissions of `g`: read.
* The 3 following letters `r--` are the permissions of `o`: read.
* The following number `1` is the number of links.
* The following string `listro` is the name of the user `u`
* The following string `listro` is the name of the group `g`

On Windows, you were using the file explorer. On Linux, you still got the notion of folder (`dossier/catalogue`) and file (`fichier/fichier r√©gulier`). A sequence a folder, separated by a separator (`/` on Linux, `\` on Windows), that may ends with a file, is called a **path** (`chemin`).

* A path starting by the **root** (`Racine`) <small>(the folder containing every other folder/file)</small>, is called **absolute path**
  * Windows: `C:` (usually)
  * Linux: `/`
* A path that is not absolute, is called **relative path**. The path is relative to the current folder you are in.
  * Windows: `.\Desktop\toto.txt`
  * Linux: `./Desktop/toto.txt`

We are using a lot relative path, as they are shorter. Every path is absolute, but we are able to use some shortcuts

* **.** (dot): alias for the current directory
* **..** (dot dot): alias for the parent directory
* **~** (tilde): alias for the HOME directory (`Domicile`). On Windows, this is the folder in which you got Desktop, Documents, ... which is `C:\Users\calistro`. And Linux, aside for some users (ex: root), it would be `/home/calistro`.
  * The home for each user is stored in `/etc/passwd`
  * The home of the current user, is stored in `$HOME`

> **Pro tip**: a file starting by a **.** (dot) is hidden.<br>
> **Pro tip**: in a path, following slashes are merged, so `//bin////../bin` is the same as `/bin/../bin` which is `/bin`.<br>
> **Pro tip**: the parent of the root, is the root itself. It means that `/../` is the same as `/`
