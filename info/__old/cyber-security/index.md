# Introduction

breaches (``piratages, failles``)
exploits

You may hear the word ``APT`` (Advanced persistent threat)
when the hackers are continuously improving their code
to stay on the servers and continue stealing
data over a long period.

## Offense / Defense

You can specialize in offense/defense

* **offense**: You will try to hack your company or their
software to look for breaches.
    * web: PHP, JS, HTML
    * network: Bash, Networking, ...
* **defense**: You will have to stop the attack as fast 
  as you can. An incident responder will be with you
  trying to guess what the hackers want and what will
  be the consequences of the attack.
    * a lot of knowledge about malware or breaches
    so that you can respond faster
    * some companies are sharing the malware used
    to attack them to help others defend themselves

## General vulnerabilities

* Spoofing (`Fraude au pr√©sident`)

Someone will usurp your CEO identity and will write
a mail asking you to secretly and urgently send him
money. It will spy on your messages with the CEO
and make it like it's really him behind the message
and because it's urgent, some gave in.

* Deceptive security

You will use lures to bait the attacking and earn
more time.
