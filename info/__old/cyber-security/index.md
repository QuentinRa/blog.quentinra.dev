# Introduction

In this course, you will learn about the most known
breaches (``piratages, failles``) and what's the
cyberworld.

Cyberwar is dangerous because

* anyone can take part in it (not reserved to countries
    like before)
* in most cases, a computer is enough (the cost is not that high)
* the offensive (the one hacking) has an advantage
since he can choose when (it's a surprise for the defender)

You may hear the word ``APT`` (Advanced persistent threat)
when the hackers are continuously improving their code
to stay on the servers and continue stealing
data over a long period.

And that's why **cyber-experts** are more than ever
needed by companies.

## Offense / Defense

You can specialize in offense/defense

* **offense**: You will try to hack your company or their
software to look for breaches.
    * web: PHP, JS, HTML
    * network: Bash, Networking, ...
* **defense**: You will have to stop the attack as fast 
  as you can. An incident responder will be with you
  trying to guess what the hackers want and what will
  be the consequences of the attack.
    * a lot of knowledge about malware or breaches
    so that you can respond faster
    * some companies are sharing the malware used
    to attack them to help others defend themselves

Also, a lot of organizations are offering bounties for breaches
to persons like you and me. I think it's quite interesting
to look a what kind of breaches got reported like
[here](https://bounty.github.com/) for GitHub. I recently
found this website [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/)
which is quite good too.

You may check <https://nvd.nist.gov/general> 
or [nvd search](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Basic&results_type=overview&search_type=all)
if you are looking for vulnerabilities. I'm liking
this page a lot [snyk.io/vuln](https://snyk.io/vuln) since
they are sometimes giving quite good explanations and examples.

## General vulnerabilities

* Spoofing (`Fraude au pr√©sident`)

Someone will usurp your CEO identity and will write
a mail asking you to secretly and urgently send him
money. It will spy on your messages with the CEO
and make it like it's really him behind the message
and because it's urgent, some gave in.

* Deceptive security

You will use lures to bait the attacking and earn
more time.

## Web vulnerabilities

Cookies mustn't be used, and you should not trust anything
that's stored in the client browser.

* [Cookies and Sessions](web/cookies.md)

Beware of file upload, someone might send some script
one your server and may be able to run it.

* [FileUpload and ReverseScript](web/upload.md)

## Looking for someone

You may want to look for other persons having the same
username or from an image, searching who this person
is... These links may help
