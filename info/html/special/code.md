# Code

[Go back](..)

You can write some code using **code** wrapped in
a **pre**.

**pre** is a tag that will render your HTML code
exactly like you wrote it inside your code (same spaces,
indents, ...).

```html
<pre><code
>some code here
...
...</code>
</pre>
```

Because of the pre tag, you must write your code right
after the ``>`` and end the code tag right after your code.
If you want some highlight then you would need to learn JS
but it's something quite easy to do.

<hr class="sl">

You may write some <code>inline code</code> by directly
writing a code tag inside a paragraph.

```html
<p>
    You may write some <code>inline code</code> by directly
    writing a code tag inside a paragraph.
</p>
```

<hr class="sr">

<pre><code
>some code here
...
...</code>
</pre>

**and with some style**

<pre class="language-html"><code
>some code here
...
...</code>
</pre>
