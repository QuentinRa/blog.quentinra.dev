# span

[Go back](..)

A tag doing nothing but used to wrap text.

```html
<p>a paragraph <span>with some text that we
may still later</span>.</p>

<span>Also since span is not forcing a new
line like p, </span><span>the following tags
(so this span) will be on the same line!</span>
```

<hr class="sr">

<p>a paragraph <span>with some text that we
may still later</span>.</p>

<span>Also since span is not forcing a new
line like p, </span><span>the following tags
(so this span) will be on the same line!</span>
