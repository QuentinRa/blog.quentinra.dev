# Paragraphs

[Go back](..)

You use the tag **p**.

```html
<p> here some text</p>

<p>
Here another paragraph
were I wrote some text.
</p>
```

> Note that when a tag **p** is closed,
> the following content will be added in a new line (usually
> elements are added right after another tag).
>
> I could also says it with an example like
> putting a paragraph and an image
> in the same line is impossible (without stylesheet) unless
> you put the image since the p tag.

<div class="sr"></div>

<p> here some text</p>

<p>
Here another paragraph
were I wrote some text.
