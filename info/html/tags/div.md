# div

[Go back](..)

The div class is a container that only wraps a lot
of tags without any visual changes. We will use it
mainly in CSS to apply put a div at some position for instance.

You can also use it to make your code look better but
do note that header, section, aside, article, ... are simply
named div so you should use these rather than a mere div.

```html
<div>
    <h3>a title here</h3>
    <p>We got a paragraph</p>
    <span>some spans</span>
    <span>some spans...</span>
</div>
```

<hr class="sr">

Here some example of a style applied to the div
(you will learn that later, don't try it at home
since you can't have this result even if you copy
and paste the code).

<div class="text-warning bg-dark p-3">
    <h3>a title here</h3>
    <p>We got a paragraph</p>
    <span>some spans</span>
    <span>some spans...</span>
</div>
