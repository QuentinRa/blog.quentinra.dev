# Screen recorders

[Go back](..)

Some links and tools to help you record your screen, or a part of it.

If you have Nvidia GeForce, then you may try to get <kbd>ALT+Z</kbd> working. I didn't manage to make it work, since a menu was missing for me, but on my old computer, I could.

Otherwise, I'm using

* "Screen Recorder Pro For Win10" (free, ads, Windows store)
* [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/)
  * [Official GitHub repository](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif)
  * "ScreenToGif" on the Windows store
