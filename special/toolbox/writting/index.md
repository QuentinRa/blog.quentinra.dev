# Fixing typos

[Go back](..)

In English, the best tool so far is <https://grammarly.com> 
for me because

* it's free as long as you create an account
* it's fixing a lot of mistakes, including the problems
  like a word making no sense here etc.

I do enjoy using <https://languagetool.org/> (with
an account too), but there are a lot more false positives
hints.
