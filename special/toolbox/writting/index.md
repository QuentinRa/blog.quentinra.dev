# Fixing typos

[Go back](..)

I think, it's quite useful to have tools that are reading and telling you what mistakes made (vocabulary, grammar, tone, punctuation, etc.). 

In English, the best tool for me so far  is [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com).

* it's free as long as you create an account (🙁)
* it's fixing a lot of mistakes, including the problems like a word making no sense in a context, etc.

I do enjoy using <https://languagetool.org/> (with an account too), but there is a lot more of false positives.
