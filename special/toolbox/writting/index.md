# Fixing typos

[Go back](..)

I'm quite usefull having tools that are reading and telling you what mistake you made (vocabulary, grammar, tone, punctuation, etc.). 

In English, the best tool so far is [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) for me.

* it's free as long as you create an account
* it's fixing a lot of mistakes, including the problems like a word making no sense in a context, etc.

I do enjoy using <https://languagetool.org/> (with an account too), but there are a lot more false positives hints.
