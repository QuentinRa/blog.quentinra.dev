# Shorten URL

[Go back](..)

You can make a URL shorter (or at least that's the goal) with [git.io](https://git.io/) (by GitHub/Microsoft, **only for Git URLs**). You can find which URL is hidden with [httpstatus](https://httpstatus.io/) (or by actually opening it ðŸ™„).

I'm using [shorturl.at](https://www.shorturl.at/), but I'm still looking for better solutions.
