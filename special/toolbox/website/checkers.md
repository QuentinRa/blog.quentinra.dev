# Websites checkers

[Go back](..)

Here are some extensions you can use
to check if a website seems legit (based on users
feedback)

* [Web of Trust (WOT)](https://www.mywot.com/)
* [Norton Safe Web](https://fr.norton.com/feature/safe-web)

If you are want to be more anonymous, you may also look at
[coveryourtracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/) 
to check if you are easy prey.

And you may install,

* [privacy badger extension](https://www.eff.org/pages/privacy-badger).
* and/or the [DuckDuckGo extension](https://duckduckgo.com/app)
