# Websites checkers

[Go back](..)

Here are some extensions you can use
to check if a website seems legit (based on users
feedback)

* [Web of Trust (WOT)](https://www.mywot.com/)
* [Norton Safe Web](https://fr.norton.com/feature/safe-web)

Personally, norton safe web helped me twice (for
WinCaml and for mangadex.org cache poisoning attack or
something like this when the code source got leaked).
