# About the application

[Go back](..#discord)

The desktop application was made using electron
which means that the discord desktop app is simply
running in a chromium-browser.

* you can use ``CTRL-SHIFT-I`` and open the developer tools
* you can use ``CTRL-R`` to refresh discord
* ...

Pressing shift while hovering a message show a small
popup allowing to get the message-id/channel-id
and the guild-id (used in the API). You can also
delete/... a message using this but most people
are using their right-click for these.
