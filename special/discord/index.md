# Introduction

This isn't a course promoting discord,
and you should already know that discord
is an application allowing users to create

* guilds (=a server)
* channels (to chat/talk)

This course are a gathering on notes about
discord and discord API.

## About the application

The desktop application was made using electron
which means that discord desktop app is simply
running in a chromium browser.

* you can use ``CTRL-SHIFT-I`` and open the developer tools
* you can use ``CTRL-R`` to refresh discord (no real use for this)
* ...

Pressing shift while overing a message show a small
popup allowing to get the message id/channel id
and the guild id (used in the api). You can also
delete/... a message using this but most people
are using the right click for these.

The messages are allowing a lot of markdown syntax
so you can use

* ``**bold**``, ``*italic*``, ``~~strikethrough~~``
* writing <code>\`\`some inline code\`\`</code> or some code block

<pre class="language-ld">
<code class="language-ld"
>```c
int main(void){

}
```</code>
</pre>

* spoiler: ``||text||``
* quote: ```> quote```
