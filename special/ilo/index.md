# ILO

ILO is not an easy course so you will need strength
or backup in order to master it, or just survive in it.

* [Figures TP](figures/index.md)
* [Lists TP](lists/index.md)
* [Tchat TP](tchat/index.md)
* [MCQ about TPs](mcq.md)

And that's all I can do. As a side note, we have a **Java** course
with a part about **JavaFX** and **Tests** with JUnit.
We also have a course about **Design patterns** and **C++**.
