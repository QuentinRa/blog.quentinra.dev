# ILO

ILO is not an easy course so you will need strength
or backup in order to master it, or just survive in it.

## First practical class

If you do have a TP using JUnit3/JUnit4 called
"TP FIGURES" then

* in order to do it in ``VSCode``, you should
simply open it and that's okay.
* in order to open it in ``IntelliJ``, you would
have 
  * either remove the class `RunAllTests.java`
  * or ``Project Structure`` (CTRL+ALT+MAJ+S) 
      * then libraries
      * then click on add from maven 
      * import all theses
        * ``org.junit.platform:junit-platform-suite-api:1.7.0``
        * ``org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.7.0``
        * ``org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher:1.7.0``
        * ``org.junit.vintage:junit-vintage-engine:5.7.0``
        * ``org.junit.platform:junit-platform-runner:1.7.0``
      * do not add all the files of the teacher at once since in that
  case you won't be able to test without coding everything
  since IDEA only compile if everything is working.
  
You might want to code in ``VSC`` seeing that but you
may regret it someday, for now that's okay, but try
it later for instance for the <s>project</s> "TP TCHAT".

Some piece of advice would be that you like will be easier
starting in one of thoses instead of eclipse. Feel
free to check tutorial about IntelliJ [here](../../tools/jetbrains/index.md).
