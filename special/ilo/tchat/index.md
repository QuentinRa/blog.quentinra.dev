# TP TCHAT

First the TP is in two parts

* simply answer some question (but **don't code 
  any todo**)
* then wait for JavaFX project, and code it. When you
will have to test with a server, run the server
  from the previous TP (nothing to do aside running)
  and that's it.

## Choose your IDE

I highly recommends using **IntelliJ** (easy to learn) for this one,
since that's may be your first time with JavaFX and
IntelliJ have a great support for JavaFX. You can solve
in less than 30 seconds problems like
``Can't load FXML``.

* [Eclipse Setup](ide/eclipse.md)
* [IntelliJ IDEA Setup](ide/idea.md)
* [VSCode Setup](ide/vsc.md)
