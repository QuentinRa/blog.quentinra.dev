# public_html

If you didn't, create a ``public_html`` in your home
Don't forget to set the permissions for
a folder like

* chmod `700`: seems like the minimum for a .php
* chmod `744`: seems like the minimum for a .html
* chmod `711`: seems like the minimum for a folder
* chmod ``711``: on your home folder
* chmod ``711``: on public_html folder
