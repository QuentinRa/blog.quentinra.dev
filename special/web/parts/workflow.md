## Simple HTML/CSS/JS Only project

If you are making a simple HTML/CSS/JS project, then
the usual workflow is

```bash
# your project root
simple_html_project/
├── assets
│   ├── css # your css files
│   │   ├── print.css
│   │   └── style.css
│   ├── files # your files (pdf, txt, ...)
│   │   ├── example.pdf
│   │   └── example.txt
│   ├── img # images
│   │   └── example.png
│   ├── js # scripts
│   │   └── example.js
│   └── pages # other html pages
│       └── another_html.html
└── index.html # index

## PHP Project

**My template**

I created a simple PHP template
[here](https://github.com/memorize-code/web-project-template).
To use it efficiently, you should check out the Jetbrains course and
PHPStorm course. 

* MVC
* Databases (example of simple/prepared request, PDO)
* Separation of header/nav/main/footer
* composer file (if needed)
* translations
* tests

**2019/2020 template**

This template was used in 2019-2020 by a lot of
students [here](https://github.com/Kirouane/ensiie-project).
It's easy to use but the MVC isn't set in place and
composer/docker knowledge are required (easy to learn).

* Docker
* composer
* Databases (example of simple request, PDO)
* tests

**TP template**

You may also use the **tp2** as a template, that's worked
for a lot of students but be **great** and don't do
that okay? The template is
[here](https://github.com/memorize-code/memorize-references/raw/main/special/web/template-tp.zip).
