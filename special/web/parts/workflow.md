## Simple HTML/CSS/JS Only project

If you are making a simple HTML project, then
the usual workflow is

```none
* /
    * assets/
        * css/
            * style.css
        * img/
        * js/
    * pages/
        * another_html.html
        * ...
    * index.html
````

## PHP Project

**My template**

I created a simple PHP template
[here](https://github.com/memorize-code/web-project-template).
To use it efficiently, you should check out the Jetbrains course and
PHPStorm course.

**2019/2020 template**

This template was used in 2019-2020 by a lot of
students [here](https://github.com/Kirouane/ensiie-project)
but I think it is not easy to start with it.

**TP template**

You may also use the **tp2** as a template, that's worked
for a lot of students but be **great** and don't do
that okay? The template is
[here](https://github.com/memorize-code/memorize-references/raw/main/special/web/template-tp.zip).
