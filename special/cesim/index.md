# Cesim

This course is about management using CESIM
hotel simulation game. The game is fun, but since we need to learn
a lot from our failures even through we are graded,
we are sharing some feedback here.

* Their website is [here](https://www.cesim.com/)
* You will login [here](https://sim.cesim.com/)

## How grades are calculated

At the end of the 8 turns, you must have

1. the greatest increase of
   ``taux de retour cumulé aux actionnaires``. 
   The ranking is made with the value at ``turn=8`` minus
   the value at ``turn=4``.
2. the greatest ``taux de retour cumulé aux actionnaires``
at ``turn=8``.
3. the report

You will get two grades according to your ranking
for 1 and 2. The final grade
is the mean of your three scores.

1. 19/20 (First)
2. 17/20
3. 15/20
4. 13/20
5. 11/20
6. 9/20
7. 8/20 (Last)

**You are losing 2 points on the final grade, if you end up in
bankrupt** (debt $\ge$ 100%).

*Please take note that this course is testing your luck,
not your management skills*.

## The main idea

You got two periods: winter and summer. You first
start a bit before winter and will take some decisions
for the next winter. Then the timeline will advance and
you will make decisions for the next summer. You will
do that for **8** turns.

You are usually in a team of 4 to 5 persons. Each
one of you have a column in ``Décisions > Liste des décisions``.
We then countdown reach 0, the decisions that will be used
for the game are in the column having the name
of your team.

You will have some time (a lot, at the start,
and only ~1 hour around the end) to make some decisions
on your column then merge everything with
``Enregistrer ... d'équipe`` to save your decisions.

At the end of the 4th turn, you will submit a report
and have a grade. This grade is only for you to know
how much you could have with this report
and what you did wrong. The grades for the report in our group
were all between ``7/20 and 12/20``...

## Presentation of the website

**Planning**: read it and **don't forget** the deadlines :)

**Manuals**: some documentation about the website,
may be useful for the report or the vocabulary

**Results**: explained later, the results of each turn

**Decisions**: take your decisions here
  * **Conditions du marché** : **READ IT**.
    You will have some information 
    that may or not have an impact. 
    Still, you can guess **how many clients** you will have.
    (if you see 2000 then you can expect at least 2500/3000 
    if you ratio price/quality is good.
    You can expect a lot more if your price is low
    (60\\$\70\\$ is "low" for us))
  * **Ventes**: 
    you can sell at the ``guichet``/counter 
    or to agencies (you should sell as most as possible to agencies). 
    And you can do some marketing, as we noticed it will
    increase by a bit the agencies' price for some time
    (a lot for this period, a little bit less in the next periods).
  * **Opérations**: manage your hotel
    * repair (quality++, money--)
    * buy rooms
    * reduce ``coûts administratifs``: 
      seems to take a lot of money but didn't do anything
      (no major changes if increased a lot like 40k from
      5k...). Seems related to the amount of money taken by the taxes.
    * reduce ``coûts directs``: tested but not found any changes
      (the ``coûts directs``'s value in 
      results didn't seem to change nor impact the quality).
    * hire staff (permanent/temporary)
    * train staff (reduce stress, increase their skills and quality)

> The blue cases are the expected value of something. 
> You will have to guess what value "something" will have
> in the next turn. Your estimated result is calculated
> using the blue cases values, that's why
> you should write your values carefully.

## Reading results

Here are some notes about how to read your results
after each turn.

* check your ``CA = Chiffre d'affaires`` (compare it with others)
* check your ``résultat`` (>0 ? why ?)
  * who create the most ``valeur ajouté`` (plus value)
    * action price ?
    * ``bénéfices cumulés``
    * ``taux de retour aux actionnaires`` **!!!**
* finance
  * debt (check that you are under 100%)
  * check investments
  * check ``dividendes``
  
And now what's more useful

* number of reservations, number of rooms
* quality (seems useless, no changes in the numbers of reservations but whatever,
  the price is the most important factor)
* staff
* **price**

``dividends`` are
a part of your ``result`` meaning that you mustn't give
too many dividends (without explaining why
in the report). Your dividend rate should be stable,
for instance, xxx each winter and
yyy each summer or zzz each year or ttt each
period.

## Some help for your strategy

In winter, you will have fewer clients.  Two strategies you may use

* save your money by reducing costs / report them for the next period
* invest for the next period

You can take these into consideration

* permanent staff
  * don't take too much of them otherwise you will pay a lot each winter for nothing 
  * you may use temporary staff.
  * the cost for the staff will keep increasing so
    do not wait too much
  * we hired a permanent at the 1rst turn,
    you may hire another one later, more may be too much.
* training staff may help you avoiding hiring temporary staff
* reducing marketing? (5k?)
* less training cost?
* fewer renovations?
* cheaper rooms?
* sell as much as possible to agencies?
* fewer dividends?

The ``retour cumulté aux actionnaire`` is the sum
of all your results. Meaning the more money to gain,
the more this value increases. But having a positive
result means that you will pay taxes.

In summer

* cheap rooms?
* a lot of marketing?
* full training cost? (10k?)
* full renovations?
* a lot of dividends

You may also go abroad (international), but if you do it
at the start (turn=1) then be careful to not have a debt>100%.
Going abroad will increase what you earn since they
are usually a lot to sell to agencies. 
You can be greedy and keep some rooms for >100$/room.
Still having more rooms means more costs!

## Report (feedback)

Here is some feedback about the report

* identify your competitors
* always compare yourself with your competitors
* find 6 to 10 relevant ratios
* what's your strategy?
* revenues (``CA``) per room?
* Previsions vs Result
* market share (`part de marché`)
* profits returned to the shareholders

And what the teacher gave us

* report from turns 1-4 and 4-8
* **5 pages** + annexes (tables, graphs)
* for the shareholders
* strategy, future developments, goals
* means used to reach your goals (marketing...)
* compare the strategy expected and what happened
* <https://www.random.org/> (from $8$ to $12$, $\pm\ 2$)
