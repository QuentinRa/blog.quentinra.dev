# Cesim

This is a course about management using CESIM
HOTELS game. The game is fun but since we need to learn
a lot with our failures, and we are graded we are sharing
here some feedback.

## How grades are calculated

At the end of the 8 turns, you must have

1. the greatest increase of 
``taux de retour cumulé aux actionnaires``. The ranking
  is made with the value at ``turn=8`` minus the 
  value at ``turn=4``.
2. the greatest ``taux de retour cumulé aux actionnaires``
at ``turn=8``.
3. the report

And **you are loosing 2 points if you ends up in
bankrupt** (debt >= 100%).

The main idea is that you will be ranked for 1 and 2. You
got a grade, looking like this (may change)

1. 19/20
2. 17/20
3. 14/20
5. 11/20
6. 9/20
7. 8/20

Then your file grade is the mean of your three grades.
*Please take note that the part of this UE
is testing your luck since no one will actually tells you
what are your mistakes nor how you could improve.*

## The main idea

You got some seasons : winter and summer. You first
start a bit before winter and will take some decisions
for the next winter. Then the timeline will advance and
you will take decisions for the next summer. You will
do that for **8** turns.

You are usually in a team of 4 to 5 persons. Each
one of you have a column in ``Décisions > Liste des décisions``.
We then countdown reach 0, the decisions that will be used
for the game are in the column having the name
of your team.

You will have some times (a lot at the beginning but
only ~1 hour around the end) to make some decisions
on your column then merge everything with
``enregistrer ...`` to save your decisions.

At the end of the 4th turn, you will submit a report
and have a grade. This grade is only for you to know
how much points you could have with this report
and what you did wrong. The grades in our year
were all in the range ``7/20 up to 12/20``...

## Reading results

Here are some notes about how to read your results
after each turn.

* check your ``CA = Chiffre d'affaires`` (compare it with others)
* check your ``résultat`` (>0 ? why ?)
  * who create the most ``valeur ajouté`` (plus value)
    * action price ?
    * ``bénéfices cumulés``
    * ``taux de retour aux actionnaires`` **!!!**
* finance
  * debt (check that you are under 100%)
  * check investments
  * check ``dividendes``
  
And now what's really useful

* count of reservations, of room
* quality (seems useless, price matter)
* staff
* **price**

Beware of the teacher note. ``dividendes`` are a part
of your ``résultat`` meaning that you mustn't give
too much dividends (without explaining why
in the report). Also he wants your dividend rate
to be stable, for instance xxx each winter and
yyyy each summer or zzz each year or ttt each
period.
