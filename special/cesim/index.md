# Cesim

This is a course about management using CESIM
HOTELS game. The game is fun but since we need to learn
a lot with our failures, and we are graded we are sharing
here some feedback.

## How grades are calculated

At the end of the 8 turns, you must have

1. the greatest increase of 
``taux de retour cumulé aux actionnaires``. The ranking
  is made with the value at ``turn=8`` minus the 
  value at ``turn=4``.
2. the greatest ``taux de retour cumulé aux actionnaires``
at ``turn=8``.
3. the report

And **you are loosing 2 points if you ends up in
bankrupt** (debt >= 100%).

The main idea is that you will be ranked for 1 and 2. You
got a grade, looking like this (may change)

1. 19/20
2. 17/20
3. 14/20
5. 11/20
6. 9/20
7. 8/20

Then your file grade is the mean of your three grades.
