# Cesim

This is a course about management using CESIM
HOTELS game. The game is fun but since we need to learn
a lot with our failures, and we are graded we are sharing
here some feedback.

* Their website is [here](https://www.cesim.com/)
* You will login [here](https://sim.cesim.com/)

## How grades are calculated

At the end of the 8 turns, you must have

1. the greatest increase of 
``taux de retour cumulé aux actionnaires``. The ranking
  is made with the value at ``turn=8`` minus the 
  value at ``turn=4``.
2. the greatest ``taux de retour cumulé aux actionnaires``
at ``turn=8``.
3. the report

And **you are loosing 2 points if you ends up in
bankrupt** (debt >= 100%).

The main idea is that you will be ranked for 1 and 2. You
got a grade, looking like this (may change)

1. 19/20
2. 17/20
3. 14/20
5. 11/20
6. 9/20
7. 8/20

Then your file grade is the mean of your three grades.
*Please take note that the part of this UE
is testing your luck since no one will actually tells you
what are your mistakes nor how you could improve.*

## The main idea

You got some seasons : winter and summer. You first
start a bit before winter and will take some decisions
for the next winter. Then the timeline will advance and
you will take decisions for the next summer. You will
do that for **8** turns.

You are usually in a team of 4 to 5 persons. Each
one of you have a column in ``Décisions > Liste des décisions``.
We then countdown reach 0, the decisions that will be used
for the game are in the column having the name
of your team.

You will have some times (a lot at the beginning but
only ~1 hour around the end) to make some decisions
on your column then merge everything with
``enregistrer ...`` to save your decisions.

At the end of the 4th turn, you will submit a report
and have a grade. This grade is only for you to know
how much points you could have with this report
and what you did wrong. The grades in our year
were all in the range ``7/20 up to 12/20``...

## Presentation of the website

**Planning**: : read it and **don't forget** the dates when turns
are ending...

**Manuals**: some documentation about the website.

**Results**: turn results, check next part

**Decisions**: take your decisions here
  * **Conditions du marché** : READ THIS. You will have some information that
  may or not have an impact. Still you can guess how many clients you will have.
  (if you see 4000 then you can expect at least 2000 if you ratio price/quality
    is good. You can expect a lot more if your price is low (according
    to other like 60$-70$), even in Winter!)
  * **Ventes**: you can sell at the ``guichet`` or to agencies (you should
    sell as most as possible to agencies). And you can do some marketing,
    as we noticed it will increase by a bit the agencies' price for some times
    (the current one a lot, and a little bit less in the next periods).
  * **Opérations**: manage your hotel
    * repair (quality++, money--)
    * buy rooms
    * reduce ``coûts administratifs``: seems to take a lot of money but didn't really
    did anything (no major changes if increased a lot like 40k with 5k...). Seems
    related to the amount of money taken by the taxes.
    * reduce ``coûts directs`` : tested but not found any changes (the ``coûts directs``
      in results didn't seem to change nor impact the quality).
    * hire staff (permanent/temporary)
    * train staff (reduce stress, increase their skills and quality)

> blue cases are the expected value of something. So you will have to guess
> what this case will have in value in the next turn. Your estimated result
> will use theses to show how many money you will have in the next turn. So write
> some values carefully.

## Reading results

Here are some notes about how to read your results
after each turn.

* check your ``CA = Chiffre d'affaires`` (compare it with others)
* check your ``résultat`` (>0 ? why ?)
  * who create the most ``valeur ajouté`` (plus value)
    * action price ?
    * ``bénéfices cumulés``
    * ``taux de retour aux actionnaires`` **!!!**
* finance
  * debt (check that you are under 100%)
  * check investments
  * check ``dividendes``
  
And now what's really useful

* count of reservations, of room
* quality (seems useless, price matter)
* staff
* **price**

Beware of the teacher note. ``dividendes`` are a part
of your ``résultat`` meaning that you mustn't give
too much dividends (without explaining why
in the report). Also he wants your dividend rate
to be stable, for instance xxx each winter and
yyyy each summer or zzz each year or ttt each
period.

## Some help for your strategy

In winter, you will have less clients.  Two strategies you may use

* save your money by reducing costs / report them for the next period
* invest for the next period

Things like theses can be taken into consideration

* permanent staff: don't take too much of them otherwise you will
pay a lot each winter for nothing. You may use temporary staff.
* train staff main help to avoid hiring temporary staff
* reduce marketing? (5k?)
* less training cost?
* less renovations?
* cheap rooms?
* sell as much as possible to agencies?
* less dividends?

The ``retour cumulté aux actionnaire`` is the sum
of all your results. Meaning the more money to gain,
the more this value increase. But having a positive
result means that you will pay taxes.

In summer

* cheap rooms?
* a lot of marketing?
* full training cost? (10k?)
* full renovations?
* a lot of dividends

You may also go abroad (international), but if you do it
at the start (turn=1) then be carefully to not have a debt>100%.
Going abroad will really increase what you earn since they
are usually a lot sell to agencies and then you can
sell a lot of room for >100$/room really easily. Still
more rooms means more costs!
