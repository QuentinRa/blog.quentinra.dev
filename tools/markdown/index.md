# Markdown

Markdown, associated with the ``.md`` extension like
for `README.md`,
is commonly used in documentation files or to write
simple documents...
You can learn it in a couple of minutes.
Here is an [amazing markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Titles

You got 6 kinds of titles, created using ``#``.
The more ``#`` you add, the smaller your title becomes.

```markdown
# h1 - really big title
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6 - really small title
```

**Note**: be sure to leave a space after ``#``

<hr class="sr">

## Basic text

```markdown
Here is a text
that continues here.

This is another paragraph.
\
This is still the same paragraph, but you should
not use this uncommon syntax.

This **text is in bold** while this *text is in italic*.
This is also in __bold__ while this is also in _italic_.
This is in ***bold and italic***.

And this is a ~~strikethrough text~~ but it's not
supported everywhere it (ex: this website does not).
```

<hr class="sl">

## Lists

You may use ``*`` or `-` or `+`. It looks like this

```markdown
* an item
* another item
    * an item of a sub-list
    that have a long sentence
    * and again another item
* a 3rd item
```

You can replace ``*`` by a number to make
an ordered list. You can mix both too.

```markdown
1. an item
2. another item
    * an item of a sub-list
    that have a long sentence
    * and again another item
3. a 3rd item
```

<hr class="sr">

## Code

You can write some ``inline code`` using inverted quotes

```markdown
You can write some `inline code` using inverted quotes 
```

and you can write a lot of code, using this syntax.
Note that ``c`` is the language used
for highlighting the code.

<pre class="language-c">
<code class="language-c"
>```c
int main(void){

}
```</code>
</pre>

<hr class="sl">

## Links and images

```markdown
For **link**: [text that will be shown](https://example.com)
For an **image**: ![text if the image is not found](https://lgs-games.com/assets/icon64.png)

You can create a **link with a text shown when hovered** with
[text that will be shown](https://example.com "some text here")

You could create a link easily with <https://example.com>.
```

<hr class="sr">

## Table

This is NOT supported everywhere, but you
can make a table with this code

```markdown
| Column name | Column name |
| ------ | ------ |
| tab[0][0] | tab[0][1] |
| tab[1][0] | tab[1][1] |
| tab[2][0] | tab[2][1] |
| tab[3][0] | tab[3][1] |
| tab[4][0] | tab[4][1] |
| tab[5][0] | tab[5][1] |
```

You can center the column content by adding
``:---:`` instead of `---`. You can align the
content to the right/left by only adding ``:``
at the right/left of ```---```.

## emojis

You can write ``:emoji:`` to render an emoji, with
"emoji" the one you want. The list of values can be found
here

* [markdown-emojis](https://github.com/markdown-templates/markdown-emojis)
* [emoji-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet) (official)

<hr class="sr">

## Other features

You can make a **quote** with

```markdown
> some quote
```

And you can use **horizontal separators** with

```markdown
***

---

_________________
```

You may be able to use a **checkbox** too with

```markdown
* [ ] not checked
* [x] checked
```

And you can write comments with this syntax

```markdown
[comment]: <> (a comment)

[//]: <> (This is also a comment.)

[//]: # (This may be the most platform-independent comment)
```

This is a normal code block but this is a particular case,
it's used a lot in documentation to show
"what you could do before" and "what you need to do now".
