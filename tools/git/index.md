This course will strongly refer
to [Github](https://github.com/)
but that doesn't mean that it is the only one
to offer this service, please also check

## Introduction

Git is a great tools that allows users to work on
one project together, by allowing things as

* **commits** : a save of your project
* **branch** : duplicate your project to continue
developing without breaking the ``main`` version
before **merging** all your changes into your
  ``main`` version.
  
So first of all, you need to

* [set things up locally](local-install.md)
* [set things up server-side](server-install.md)

## Basic usage

Please take not that all ``commands`` start with
``git`` then a space.

* [Get your repository from server](commands/clone.md)
* [Update your local version](commands/pull.md)
* [Save your local changes](commands/commit.md)
* [Send your changes to the server](commands/push.md)
* [Check the git status](commands/status.md)

So to summarize, a basic usage would be

```bash
# 
# Ony done once, download the repository locally 
#
git clone "https://github.com/lgs-games/memorize.git"

#
# Then inside the folder, you can do
#
# get the latest version on the server
git pull
# ... work a lot ...
# save your changes
git status
git add .
git commit -m "I worked a lot"
# then send your changes to the server
git push
```
