Here some files used in big projects
or project that may be maintained by
a community.

**.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** :
Well... I don't see a use for this file
but here a template 
[opensource-template pledge](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/opensource-template/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**.github/CONTRIBUTING.md** :
Tell others how to contribute to your project.

**.github/SECURITY.md** :
Tells how to report a security breach or what version
may receive security support.

**pom.xml** : a `maven`/`gradle` dependency file. 
It's ``maven``-only file but you can generate such
a file in ``gradle``. After having it, you may
receive a security alert on dependencies.

**requirements.txt** : same as ``pom.xml`` but
for python.
