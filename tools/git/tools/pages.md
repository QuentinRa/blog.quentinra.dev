# Github pages

[Go back](../index.md#advanced-github-concepts)

An organization or a user
can make on Github a "Github page" project. To summarize,
you can make a website from the code of a repository
having the same name as your username/organization name.
Then Github will host the website for you.

Check the [tutorial](https://pages.github.com/).

Your website URL will be like ``https://username.github.io/``.
You can change that with a custom name,
that you brought beforehand for 10$ per year (for a domain.com
for example) by following these steps
[custom-domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).

You may do your site in markdown or whatever
if you don't like web development, or at least
find something interesting for you in these links
