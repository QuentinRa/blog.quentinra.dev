# Github pages

[Go back](..)

An organization or an user
can make on github pages project. To summarize,
you can make a website from code of a repository
having the same name as your username/organization name.
Then github will host the website for you.

Check the [tutorial](https://pages.github.com/).

Your website url will be like ``https://username.github.io/``.
You can change that with a custom name,
that you brought before hand for 10$ per year (for a domain.com
for exemple) by following theses steps
[custom-domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).
