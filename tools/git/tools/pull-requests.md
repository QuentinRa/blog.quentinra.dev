# Pull request

[Go back](..)

In most cases, before merging into master, we need to ask
the permission to do that.

We do that by creating a ``Pull request`` for our branch
then wait for reviews by the others developers. If everything
is okay, they can merge it into master.

Here some Github tutorial 
[creating-a-pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

One can define the format of pull request
by creating a template file
``.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md``
