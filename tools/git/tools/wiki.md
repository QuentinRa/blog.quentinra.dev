That's a good practice to create one if you made
a big project.

Here some [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/).

You can add images using to ways

* drag and drop an image into a temporary issue, then copy
the generated link (easy, test, working)
* copy an image into your project then use
a path starting with a ``/`` or not (need to be tested,
  please edit this if not working or working)
