# git status

[Go back](../index.md#basic-usage)

Use `git status` to get the list of the files that aren't committed, the number of local commits, ...

```bash
git status
```

<hr class="sl">

## git log

For users without an interface, `git log` might also help, as it displays information about each commit.

```bash
git log
```
