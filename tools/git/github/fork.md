# Fork a repository

[Go back](../index.md#advanced-concepts)

If you want to commit/make a pull request to a repository, while you aren't a collaborator (no access rights on it), you need to fork it: create your own copy of the repository.

* go to the page of the repository
* click on the fork button ðŸ˜†

Then you can either work on the project for yourself, or

* create a branch
* submit a pull request to the initial repository

You can read the [official tutorial here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
