Here are some files used in big projects or projects that may be maintained by a community.

**.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Well... I don't see a concrete use for this file, but here is a template  [opensource-template pledge](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/opensource-template/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**.github/CONTRIBUTING.md**: Tell others how to contribute to your project.

**.github/SECURITY.md**: Tells how to report a security breach or what version may receive security support.

**pom.xml**: a `maven`/`gradle` dependency file. It's a file only used in  ``maven`` projects, but you can generate with ``gradle``. Once you have it, you will receive security alerts for your dependencies.

**requirements.txt**: same as ``pom.xml`` but for python.
