> A wiki is a group of pages written in Markdown. You will usually write the documentation of your project inside.

You can add images using one of those two ways

* drag and drop an image into a temporary issue, then copy the generated link
* copy an image into your project then use a path (if it does not work, try adding a leading `/`)
