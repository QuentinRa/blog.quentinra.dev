# Pull request

[Go back](../index.md#advanced-github-concepts)

In most cases, before a merge, since we need to ask permission. We do that by creating a ``Pull request`` for our branch, then wait for reviews by the others developers. If everything is okay, you can merge it into master. Usually, the programmer setup "checks" that must be verified before merging a pull request. Here is the official [GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

One can define the format of pull request by creating a template file ``.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md``
