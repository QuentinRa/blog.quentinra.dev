# Images and links

[Go back](..)

```rest
I can load on image like this

.. image:: src

I can write some inline link like
`name <url>`_ .

I can create a download link using
:download:`name <relative/path/file>`.

.. _name: url

Another way to use a link is this one `name`_
when we stored the link into a variable and can
refer to it later (can be declared before or after).
