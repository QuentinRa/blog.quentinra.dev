# Tips

## Optimization

Image size power of two so we could compress it.
You can compress sounds too (50% seems good).

Activate / Deactivate objects is the camera
is close / far.

## Logic

Use ``Debug.log("")`` to add logs of your game.

You can and should group variables. You can use
``[Header("name")]`` / `[Space(value)]`
before your variables declarations.

Group objects into by groups in a gameObject.

In RigidBodyComponent, use ``Interpolate`` in
interpolate (make this smoother, ...).

## Graphics

Enable ``post processing`` in Rendering.
