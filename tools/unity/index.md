# Introduction

This is not a course, simply a gathering of
notes about unity be someone still learning it.

Unity is a game engine that you can download
[here](https://store.unity.com/fr#plans-individual),
you may use the student plan (if you are a student)
and you should also apply to
[github student pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
You will then download

* **unity hub**: a software to manage unity versions
and projects
* **unity**: downloaded through unity hub, usually peoples
are using LTS (Long term support) versions of unity
  because unity will still be maintained (bugs only)
  for 2 years.
  
Then what I did after that was playing with the samples
and following tutorials like
