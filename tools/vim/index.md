# Introduction

*vim*, for *vi improved*, is a text editor.
## How to install and run vim ?
### Windows

###Â MacOS

### Ubuntu, Debian

Install : `sudo apt-get install vim`
Run : `vim` or `vi`
Could take the file to open as an argument.
## HELP, I'm can't exit vim.
If you are trapped with vim, keep calm, and press `Esc`, then `:q!`.
`Esc` will bring (back) vim to its **normal mode** (if we could call it normal...).
`:q!` is the command to force to quit vim, that is to say, to exit vim without saving.

More generally, the **normal mode** of vim is the state where user's input served to do some special action (move the cursor, copy, paste, erase...).
`:` is use to run a command. E.g, `q` is the command to exit vim if no edit have been done , `q!` to exit without saving and `:wq` to save and exit.
In normal mode, press `i` to enter in **insert mode**, which is the mode where you can write some text such as every other text editor. Press `Esc` to exit this mode and return to the normal one.

## How to learn to use vim ?

The best way to learn how to use vim is... to use it.
However, and thankfully, you can open a terminal and write `vimtutor`, which will teach you the basics command to use vim peacefully, in exchange of ~30 minutes of your life and brain attention.
# Command
These are the command in **normal mode**.
