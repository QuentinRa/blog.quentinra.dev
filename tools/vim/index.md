# vim

*vim*, for *vi improved* is a text editor, at least in the basic
version of it.

You may find extensions like

* GVim
* neovim

## How to install and run vim ?

You can install it using ``sudo apt-get install vim``
or whatever command you use to install packages
such as ``sudo aptitude install vim``.

Then you can run it with `vim` or `vi`, commands that could
take a file in argument such as ``vim file``. The file is created
if it's don't exists.

### HELP, I'm can't exit vim.

If you are trapped in vim, keep calm, 
and press `esc` (escape key), then `:q!`.

* `esc` will bring (back) vim to its **normal mode** 
 (if we could call it normal...).
* `:q!` is the command to force to quit vim, that is to say, to
to exit vim without saving.

### Basic configuration

Then you can configure your editor by creating
a file ``~/.virmrc``, here an example of mine

```bash
set fileencodings=UTF-8,utf-8,default,latin1 "file encoding
syntax enable "enable syntax
highlight Cursor guifg=white guibg=black "cursor color
filetype plugin indent on "indentations
set cursorline "show cursor
set tabstop=4 "tabulation size
```

# Surviving in vim ...

Here a really short summary of vim.

You have two mode (at least for now),
check at the bottom left of your screen

* `INSERTION` : called insert/edit mode
* `<nothing>` : called command/normal mode

More generally, the **normal mode** (or command mode)
of vim is the state where user's input served to do some
special action (move the cursor, copy, paste, erase...).

`:` is use to run a command. E.g, `q` is the command to exit vim
if no edit have been done , `q!` to exit without saving and
`wq` to save and exit...

In normal mode, press `i` to enter in **insert mode**,
which is the mode where you can write some text such as every
other text editor. Press `esc` to exit this mode and return to
the normal one.

Here are a summary commands (so in **command mode**)
that you will most likely need to know

* ``i`` (or `a`): switch to `INSERTION`, you can now modify the file
* ``:wq`` : save and exit
* ``:q!`` : exit without saving
* ``:q`` : exit
* ``u`` : undo
* ``h, j, l, k`` : move cursor to left, top, right, bottom

# ... and now mastering it

The best way to learn how to use vim is... to use it.
However, and thankfully, you can open a terminal and write
`vimtutor`, which will teach you the basics command 
to use vim peacefully, in exchange of ~30 minutes of your
life and brain attention.

Here some details about basic commands

* [insert](commands/insert.md)
* [move](commands/move.md)
* [delete](commands/delete.md)
* [copy](commands/copy.md)
* [search](commands/search.md)
* [replace](commands/replace.md)
* [others commands](commands/others.md)
* [cgi syntax](commands/cgi.md)
* [mystic commands](commands/special.md)

Here you have a summary
