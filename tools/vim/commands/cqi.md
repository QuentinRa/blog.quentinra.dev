# CQI syntax

[Go back](..#-and-now-mastering-it)

You can use powerful commands and some regex/patterns
using the ``cqi`` syntax.

* ``c``: a command
* ``q``: a quantity
* ``i``: an indicator

in a sentence, for example, we could say
``delete (=c) 10 (=q) lines (=i)``. Indicators would be

* ``$``: command from the cursor until the end of the line
* ``e``: end of the word
* ``.``: under the cursor
* ``c``: a line
* ``^``: from the cursor until the start of the line

You may use that in previous commands.
