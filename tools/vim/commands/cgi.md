# CGI

You can use powerful commands and some regex/patterns
using the ``cqi`` syntax.

* ``c`` : a command
* ``q`` : a quantity
* ``i`` : an indicator

in a sentence, for exemple, we could say
``delete (=c) 10 (=q) lines (=i)``. Indicators would be

* ``$`` : command from cursor until the end of the line
* ``e`` : ???
* ``.`` : under cursor
* ``c`` : a line
* ``^`` : from cursor until the start of the line

You may use that in previous commands.
