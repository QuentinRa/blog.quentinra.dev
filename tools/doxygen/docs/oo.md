# Doxygen in Object-Oriented Languages

[Go back](..#write-documentation)

**FIRST**, you should use the Javadoc in Java, not Doxygen, but I hope that you are here for other Object-Oriented languages. Here are some new tags for OO languages, you should check the `c` page for the rest of them

* `\package name`: tag for packages
* `\exception name desc`: tag for exceptions
* `\throw`: alternative to `\exception`
* `\interface name`: if there are interfaces
* `\class name`: documents a class
