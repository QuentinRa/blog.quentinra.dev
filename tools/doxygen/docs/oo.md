## Doxygen in OO

[Go back](..)

**FIRST** you should use ``Javadoc`` in `java`
not doxygen but I Hope that you are
here for other Object-Oriented languages.

Here are some new tags for OO languages,
you should check ``C`` page for the rest

* ``\package name`` : tag for packages
* ``\exception name desc`` : tag for exceptions
* ``\throw`` : alternative to `\exception`
* ``\interface name`` : if there are interfaces
* ``\class name`` : documents a class
