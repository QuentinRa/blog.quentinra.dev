# Folder

[Go back](../c.md)

You can use this trick to comment a folder or a package. Create a file ``package.dox``

```c
/** @dir headers

\authors ...
\date 2020-03-08

A description of this package/folder.
*/
```

When folders are documented, they appear in ``m.css doxygen`` files list (if you are using m.css renderer).
