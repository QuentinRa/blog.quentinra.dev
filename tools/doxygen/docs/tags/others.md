#### Some tags

[Go back](../c.md)

Theses can be used almost everywhere but
you don't see them often

* ``\deprecated why`` : if deprecated and why
* ``\bug desc`` : if bug found and a description
* ``\note desc`` : if you want to write a note with a description

And some test-related tags

* ``\test description`` : a test that may be done
* ``\pre description`` : preconditions
* ``\post description`` : post conditions
* ``\invariant description`` : invariant

As a remember, an invariant is something that won't
be changed from their value before the call of a
function.

A precondition is something that we are taking
for true.

And a post condition is something that we ensure
to make it true after the call of the function.
