# Safe browsing

[Go back](..)

If you're looking for an extension to become more anonymous or simply extensions that telling you if a website is dangerous, then you're in the right place.

Here are some extensions you can use to check if a website seems legit (based on the users' feedback)

* [Web of Trust (WOT)](https://www.mywot.com/)
* [Norton Safe Web](https://fr.norton.com/feature/safe-web)

If you are want to be more anonymous, you may also look at [coveryourtracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/) to check if you are easy prey.

And you may install,

* [privacy badger extension](https://www.eff.org/pages/privacy-badger).
* and/or the [DuckDuckGo extension](https://duckduckgo.com/app)
* [adblock](https://adblockplus.org/) and/or [ublock origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block most ads (if not all), and disable some trackers.
