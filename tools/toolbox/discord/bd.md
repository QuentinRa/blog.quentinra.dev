Better discord is a sort of software improving discord by allowing you to install plugins. You can find [the code source/the latest version here](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord/releases).

* [download the installer](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/Installer/releases/tag/v1.0.0-hotfix)
* install and restart discord
* in settings, you got new menus including plugins menu

To install new plugins, what I do is

* settings > plugin > open the plugin folder
* (`C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\plugins`)
* copy and paste a plugin inside the folder
* [the plugin can be found here](https://betterdiscord.app/plugins)
* go back to discord and don't forget to enable the plugin
* if you have a problem updating a plugin, backup the plugin data file and reinstall it.
