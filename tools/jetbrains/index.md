## Pro(s) and cons(s)

Before digging into, please take note that Jetbrains
IDE

* may take a lot of memory
* may take a lot (~3Gb per IDE) of disk space, since you will
  have to download many IDEs in most cases
* in ``Java``, you can't compile a file but always everything at all
* in ``C``, I'm not really a fan of `CMakeLists` over `Makefiles`

And here a some functionalities

* they come ``preconfigured`` so most of the time,
  download and run and that's it.
* the interface is the same in all of theirs IDEs
* they allow you to code in team by joining a friend
  with ``CodeWithMe``
* you can manage your projects with ``YouTrack``
* verify your code and giving you advices/fix : check
* generating UML from code : check
* spelling : check
* git integration, color for files : check
* code directly on a server (PHP) : check
* move easily between files, search tools : check
* can create language plugin easily : check
* connect to a database, sql integration : check
