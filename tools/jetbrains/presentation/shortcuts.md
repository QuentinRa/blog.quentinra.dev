# Shortcuts

[Go back](..#interface-presentation)

Here is my syntax for the following shortcuts

* ``a+b``: press `a` and `b` at the same time
* ``*+b``: left click and `b` at the same time
* ``@+b``: right click and `b` at the same time
* ``^+b``: select something and `b` at the same time

## most used ones

* ``CTRL+C``: copy selection or whole line
* ``CTRL+V``: paste
* ``CTRL+X``: cut selection or whole line
* ``CTRL+A``: select all
* ``CTRL+D``: duplicate line or selection
* ``CTRL+Z``: undo
* ``CTRL+SHIFT+Z``: redo

Also, take note that you can easily select a pack of lines
by pressing ``SHIFT`` and using arrows.

And the two great ones are

* ``^+CTRL+/``: do an inline comment for all lines selected.
* ``^+CTRL+SHIFT+/``: do a block comment for all lines selected.

## search

Search for ``text``

* ``CTRL+F``: look for a word in this file
* ``CTRL+SHIFT+F``: look for a word in a scope (project, ...)

You can use ``CTRL+L`` to move to the next occurrence
of your search.

Search for ``settings/classes/file/...``

* ``SHIFT+SHIFT``: open **the great** search menu

    * check recent files
    * look for settings
    * look for files, classes, methods, ...

* ``CTRL+E``: list of menus and a lot of files
* ``CTRL+SHIFT+E``: last locations where you got

<hr class="sl">

## In Object-oriented IDE languages files

* ``ALT+INSERT`` : generates methods (such as getters/setters/constructors/implements in JAVA)
* ``^+CTRL+ALT+T``: generate a bloc of code around selection (if, try catch, ...)
* ``CTRL+SHIFT+T``: generates test class
* ``CTRL+*`` : click on a method/class/... to view usages

<hr class="sr">

## You may use

* ``CTRL+SHIFT+G``: open a sort of file view menu (inside a file)
* ``^+CTRL+SHIFT+U``: uppercase to lowercase or lowercase to uppercase
* ``CTRL+G``: to move to a line
* ``CTRL+R``: replace some text
* ``ALT+7``: beware and do not use the 7 of your Numpad. This opens a 
  popup with the structure of the file. In Oriented-object languages,
you could see all the classes in a file, methods, ...
and can easily navigate to one.
* ``CTRL+ALT+MAJ+U``: generate a UML diagram of selected files
in available
* ``CTRL+ALT+U``: same as above but in a small popup like a preview
