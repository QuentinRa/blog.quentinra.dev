[Go back](../menus.md)

Analyze, is analyzing your code and telling you how to write something better. This is a summary of the warnings/errors that you're usually seeing in the right column.

Right-click on a file or a folder, then ``inspect code``.

You will have a list of your potential amelioration. You may as well suppress false warnings here.
