# Snippets

[Go back](../menus.md)

You can create customs snippets meaning when you
type ``for``, Jetbrains will show you some pre-written
code and that's a snippet.

* Open ``Settings > Editor > Live template``.
* Create a new ``live template``.
* write a name, for example ``for``
* write a description, shown when suggesting snippets
* write some code if this snippet is selected

You can create variables using ``$name$``
then go to ``edit variables`` and tunes how 
this variable should act.
