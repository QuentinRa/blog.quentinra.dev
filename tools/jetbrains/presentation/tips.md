<hr class="sl">

### Change proofreading language

<kbd>Shift-Shift</kbd>, then enter ``Proofreading``, and manage your languages.

<hr class="sr">

### Delete unused warnings

You may call a variable ``ignore``, sometimes (in a try-catch, for instance), JetBrains understand that you won't use this variable for a reason.

Otherwise, when you're using <kbd>alt+enter</kbd>, on each patch suggested you got a small arrow, and you may suppress the warning inside.

### Soft wraps

If a line is too long for being completely displayed in your screen, as it may happens in JSON files (since you can't make multilines Strings), you can enable auto-wrapping

* right after the line number,
* right-click and enable soft-wrap

If you want something permanent, 

* <kbd>Shift-Shift</kbd>
* "soft wrap"
* "soft wrap these files"
* and add your file extension

### Icon for your project

You can add an icon for your project! Simply close your project, right click on it, and "change project icon".
