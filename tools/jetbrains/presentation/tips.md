You may add here tips that many people may look for, especially when this is a tip about the configuration of the IDE.

### Zoom on scroll

<kbd>Shift-Shift</kbd> then enter `mouse wheel`, click on the only suggestion (Settings > General), and check the parameter to enable resize by scrolling.

<hr class="sr">

### Add a star (*) to modified files

<kbd>Shift-Shift</kbd>, enter `mark modified`, and switch it to ``on``. You should see your little star.

<hr class="sl">

### Change proofreading language

<kbd>Shift-Shift</kbd>, then enter ``Proofreading``, and manage your languages.

<hr class="sr">

### Delete unused warnings

You may call a variable ``ignore``, sometimes (in a try-catch, for instance), JetBrains understand that you won't use this variable for a reason.

Otherwise, when you're using <kbd>alt+enter</kbd>, on each patch suggested you got a small arrow, and you may suppress the warning inside.
