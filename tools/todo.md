    You may also add one of those files

**pom.xml**: a `maven`/`gradle` dependency file. It's a file only used in  ``maven`` projects, but you can generate with ``gradle``. Once you have it, you will receive security alerts for your dependencies.

**requirements.txt**: same as ``pom.xml`` but for python.

And enable dependabot alerts, to receive pull requests when newer versions of your dependencies are released.
