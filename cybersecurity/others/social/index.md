# Social engineering

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

The weakest link in companies are humans. They are likely to commit mistakes ðŸ”¥. Social engineering is a technique used by hackers to exploit humans into compromising the security of the organization.

**Phishing** ðŸŽ£: trick the victim using fraudulent emails/sms/messages leading them to revealing sensitive or private information.

**Spear Phishing**/`Fraude au prÃ©sident` ðŸ”«: the attacker investigates a victim in order to create a convincing mail/call that will lead them to compromise the organization. For instance, an email from the director on a friday <small>(right before going home)</small> asking them to URGENTLY transfer money without notifying anyone.
