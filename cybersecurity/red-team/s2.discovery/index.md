Discovery 🏝️, a.k.a. active recon (reconnaissance) 🕊️ is the second step of the pentester activities.

It involves gathering information about the target by probing their network or systems 🛶️, to find exploitable vulnerabilities.

* 🎯 Host discovery <small>(OS, version...)</small>
* 🕸️ Network discovery <small>(architecture...)</small>
* 🧭 Systems, services and application discovery <small>(FTP, APIs...)</small>
* ...

Unlike passive discovery, as you are directly interacting with the target, you are likely to be detected and caught 🚓.
