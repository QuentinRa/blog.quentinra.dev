# Logic flaws

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A logic flaw occurs when a programmer thinks a user will do always as they expect, and fail to handle scenario in which they don't.

* The user visit the page "payment" before the page "checkout"
* The user manually send a form and do not use the HTML form

A more concrete example is that if the developer used an HTML `SELECT` tag with a list of countries, the developer may not check the submitted value as they expect it to be within their list of countries.
