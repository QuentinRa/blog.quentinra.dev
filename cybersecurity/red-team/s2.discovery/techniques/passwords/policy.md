Before attempting attacks such as [Password Spraying](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/passwords/spraying.md) or even brute forcing, we often want to learn more about the password policy to:

* üõ°Ô∏è Is account lockout enabled?
* ü•∑ How much delay must we add before tries?
* ‚ö†Ô∏è How many tries can we perform before locking the account?
* üó∫Ô∏è Is there a minimum/maximum password length?
* üê≤ Is password complexity enabled?

We want to avoid locking accounts **at all cost**Ô∏è.

On Windows Server, there is no lockout by default, but many implement a lockout after three or five invalid passwords. Account lockout threshold reset is usually between 30 minutes and 3 hours.

Knowing the minimum length of the password and the password rules is handy to fine-tune the passwords we try.

#### Leveraging SMB

You can use [SMB](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/smb.md) credentials to obtain the password policy.

```ps
$ nxc smb [...] --pass-pol
$ nxc smb [...] --users # show 'badpasswordcount' for each user
$ enum4linux-ng [...] -P
```
