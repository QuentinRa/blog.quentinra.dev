# Framework Detection

Developers often use framework to write websites faster and more easily, as they provide pre-written common features.

<br>

#### Find a framework

* Look if the framework is credited at the bottom of the page
* Look if there is an HTML comment with the framework name/...
* Look for the default favicon of the framework. Usually, it's stored at `/favicon.ico`, although it's usually removed. If you do find one, download it, hash it (MD5), and [find it in OWASP favicon database](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database)

```bash
# Linux
curl url/favicon.ico | md5sum
# Windows (on a download favicon)
Get-FileHash .\favicon.ico -Algorithm MD5
```

[wappalyzer](https://github.com/wappalyzer/wappalyzer) (8.1k ‚≠ê) is common tool to find frameworks, and their versions. It can be installed as a browser extension or used via their [website](https://www.wappalyzer.com/). If you are using the extension, you might want to uncheck the option to send anonymous data to their website.

#### Once a framework is detected

* Try to find the version <small>(comments, check the dependencies, features...)</small>
* Look for the login page / CMS panel (if any)
* Look for common misconfiguration mistakes

You may move to the [Exploit a framework section](/cybersecurity/red-team/s3.exploitation/techniques/framework.md) as both enumeration and exploitation are closely linked.
