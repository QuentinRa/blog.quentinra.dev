# Website mapping

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

A penetration tester will have to list every feature of the website along their route. For instance,

* "list all products": `/products,`
* "list a product": `/products?id=x`

This is automatically done by tools such as [Burp](/cybersecurity/red-team/s3.exploitation/tools/burp.md) if you are redirecting requests through the proxy, even if you don't intercept them.

Anyway, it's a good practice to test the website features as a user before trying to look for vulnerabilities.

ðŸ‘‰ Don't forget the 404 page!

ðŸ‘‰ Don't forget special pages, such as the password reset page.
