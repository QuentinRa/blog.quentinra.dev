Account discovery is a self-made name to categorize techniques to find users that have an account of the website.

* üêü Try digging in the API (if any)
* üëÄ Try testing emails in the password forgot page
* üôå Try testing emails in the register page
* üìö Try to find exposed configuration files
* ‚úàÔ∏è Try to create an account
* ...

We often test weak or mostly default credentials. You can do it manually, or use [Fuzzing](fuzzing.md) with these [wordlists](/cybersecurity/red-team/_knowledge/topics/wordlists.md#accounts).
</div><div>

**Additional notes** üî•

* Brute forcing accounts is usually done if there is nothing else we can try, while fuzzing for default credentials is acceptable.

Refer to use [Fuzzing](fuzzing.md) or [network authentification tools](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/network/auth.md) such as hydra, which may also be used to brute force forms.

* Try using `xxx+anything@xxx` to register multiple accounts with the 'same' address email `xxx@xxx`. It may be handy to 'farm' accounts.

## Username Enumeration

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Login Page

[![broken_authentication](../../../../_badges/htb/broken_authentication.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/broken-authentication)

Some websites return a different message when the username was not found and when the password is incorrect, helping in enumeration.

Most websites are computing the hash at each login. If they are using an algorithm "slow enough" <small>(rare)</small> and only doing it if a user exists, then delays in responses may indicate that a user exists.

While rare, some websites prefill fields only if the user exists.

#### Register Page

[![broken_authentication](../../../../_badges/htb/broken_authentication.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/broken-authentication)

We can't register an account with an already taken username or email. It can be exploited to enumerate usernames.

#### Password Forgot/Reset Page

Websites may indicate if a user exists when we try to reset a password.

## Log In Bruteforce

#### Rate Limit

[![broken_authentication](../../../../_badges/htb/broken_authentication.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/broken-authentication)

Some websites are implementing a rate timer often using a super increasing wait time. If they are checking the `X-Forwarded-For` to avoid blocking proxies, it means we can arbitrary pick an IP to "ban".
