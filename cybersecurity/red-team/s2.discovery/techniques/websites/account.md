Account discovery is a self-made name to categorize techniques to find users that have an account of the website.

* üêü Try digging in the API (if any)
* üëÄ Try testing emails in the password forgot page
* üôå Try testing emails in the register page
* üìö Try to find exposed configuration files
* ‚úàÔ∏è Try to create an account
* ...

We often test weak or mostly default credentials. You can do it manually, or use [Fuzzing](fuzzing.md) with these [wordlists](/cybersecurity/red-team/_knowledge/topics/wordlists.md#accounts).

**Additional notes** üî•

* Brute forcing accounts is usually done if there is nothing else we can try, while fuzzing for default credentials is acceptable.

Refer to use [Fuzzing](fuzzing.md) or [network authentification tools](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/network/auth.md) such as hydra, which may also be used to brute force forms.

* Try using `xxx+anything@xxx` to register multiple accounts with the 'same' address email `xxx@xxx`. It may be handy to 'farm' accounts.

#### Login Page

[![broken_authentication](../../../../_badges/htb/broken_authentication.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/broken-authentication)

Some websites return a different message when the username was not found and when the password is incorrect, helping in enumeration.

#### Register Page

[![broken_authentication](../../../../_badges/htb/broken_authentication.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/broken-authentication)

We can't register an account with an already taken username or email. It can be exploited to enumerate usernames.
