#### Composer Vendor Folder Exposure

[![surfer](../../../../_badges/thm-p/surfer.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/surfer)

[Composer](/programming-languages/web/php/composer/index.md) is a package manager for PHP. From `composer.json`, it creates a `vendor` folder with the PHP packages.

This folder should not be available for remote users.

#### CGI Scripts

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Applications are rarely used as they are dangerous. They were often used to connect multiple applications. CGI scripts can be written in many languages. They have a few advantages and many major disadvantages. To look for them:

```shell!
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u URL/cgi/FUZZ -e .bat,.cmd
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u URL/cgi-bin/FUZZ -e .cgi,.pl,.c,.sh,.py
```

üìö Apache Tomcat returns 404 for `/cgi` even when it exists.

‚ö†Ô∏è Bash `[<4.3]` has a vulnerability called [shellshock](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6271), that can also be exploited with metasploit (`apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec`):

```shell!
$ curl -H 'User-Agent: () { :; }; <write code here>' 'URL/cgi-bin/some_script'
```
