#### PHP Bulletin Board (phpBB)

[![catpictures](../../../../_badges/thm-p/catpictures.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/catpictures)
[![phpbb_install_files](../../../../_badges/rootme/web_server/phpbb_install_files.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/Install-files)

When installing a framework, such as [phpBB](https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb), it's important to properly configure it and remove install files.

#### osCommerce ‚Äî eCommerce Framework

[![blueprint](../../../../_badges/thm-p/blueprint.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/blueprint)

[osCommerce](https://www.oscommerce.com/) is a highly vulnerable [open-source](https://github.com/osCommerce) PHP eCommerce framework using a MySQL backend.

If install files were not removed, there is a RCE where we can inject code in the database field during install `/catalog/install/index.php` which is executed when visiting `/install/includes/configure.php`.

üìö Use `oscommerce_installer_unauth_code_exec` for easy exploitation.

#### Subrion CMS

[![techsupp0rt1](../../../../_badges/thm-p/techsupp0rt1.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/techsupp0rt1)

[subrion](https://github.com/intelliants/subrion) <small>(0.3k ‚≠ê)</small> version can be identified on the manager panel located at `/panel/`. Once logged, to get a RCE:

* [Exploit File Upload CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19422): simply create and upload the usual PHP webshell but rename it as `xxx.phar`.

Upload at `/panel/uploads/` <small>(Right-click to upload)</small> and execute it at `/uploads/xxx.phar` <small>(URL encoding is not automatic!)</small>.

* [Exploit PHP Validation CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43464): Navigate to `Content>Fields>Select a field>Select Require Field>Write PHP Code`.

[![anthem](../../../../_badges/thm-p/anthem.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/anthem)

* [official documentation](https://umbraco.com/): it's a .NET CMS
* It is usually hosted on Windows with a MSSQL backend
* It (may?) uses Windows authentication <small>(xxx@domain:pass)</small>
* Config path? `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Web\Web.config`
* Version 2.12.4 is vulnerable to [RCE](https://github.com/noraj/Umbraco-RCE/) <small>(0.1k ‚≠ê, XSLT upload)</small>
