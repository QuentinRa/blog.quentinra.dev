Fuzzing refers to injecting data into something to study how it reacts. A keyword "FUZZ" is replaced with a word from a wordlist. It can be used to easily inject words in a URL, a form, or basically anything üí•.

* Guessing a [subdomain](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/websites/subdomains.md)? `FUZZ.example.com`
* [Forced browsing](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/websites/forced_browsing.md)? `example.com/FUZZ`
* Find [Insecure Direct Object References](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/websites/idor.md)? `example.com?id=FUZZ`
* Find [Hidden Parameters](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/websites/hidden_parameters.md)? `example.com?FUZZ=xxx`
* Find [Virtual Hosts](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/websites/vhosts.md) `example.com` and `Host: FUZZ.example.com`
* ...

FUZZ will be replaced with the values in the wordlist, one by one.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that `example.com/FUZZ.php` and `example.com/FUZZ -e .php` are often different. The latter will look for both `FUZZ` and `FUZZ.php`.

Common fuzzing tools are:

* [ffuf](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/enumeration/web/ffuf.md)
* [wfuzz](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/enumeration/web/wfuzz.md)
* [gobuster](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/enumeration/web/gobuster.md#fuzzing)
