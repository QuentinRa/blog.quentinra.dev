When we discover a service, we often want to test default credentials as it is a fast and easy attack vector. üîè

We often use one of these tools:

* [hydra](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/cracking/auth/hydra.md)
* [nmap](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/scanners/ports/nmap.md#brute-force-scripts)
* [CrackMapExec](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/cracking/auth/cme.md)
* [NetExec](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/cracking/auth/nxc.md)
* [Crowbar](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/cracking/auth/crowbar.md)
* ncrack
* patator
* [medusa](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/cracking/auth/medusa.md)

Look at [wordlists#accounts](/cybersecurity/red-team/_knowledge/topics/wordlists.md#accounts) to find handy wordlists.

**Additional notes**

* If we don't find any valid credentials nor any other attack vector, we may try to use wordlists with the most common passwords. ü™≤

* Otherwise, we may also try our luck with [password spraying](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/passwords/spraying.md). To avoid account lockout, we may be forced to use it anyway. üóùÔ∏è By default there is no account lockout on Windows Server.

* When testing a list of usernames, remember to add the switch to stop when one credential is found. ‚ö†Ô∏è
