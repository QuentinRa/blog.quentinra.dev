# LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Inside an internal windows network, when a DNS server is not available or a DNS request fails, LLMNR and NBT-NS may be used.

* üê≤ LLMNR uses UDP port 5355
* üê≤ NBT-NS uses UDP port 137
* ‚ò†Ô∏è NBT-NS may be used in older Windows-based networks
* ‚ò†Ô∏è NBT-NS may be used when LLMNR fails to find a host

Both protocols are vulnerable to multiple attacks such as spoofing.
