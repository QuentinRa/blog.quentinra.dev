Inside an internal windows network, when a DNS request fails or a DNS server is not available, LLMNR and NBT-NS may be used to send a local query to machines within the subnet.

* üê≤ LLMNR uses UDP port 5355
* üê≤ NBT-NS uses UDP port 137
* ‚ò†Ô∏è NBT-NS may be used in older Windows-based networks
* ‚ò†Ô∏è NBT-NS may be used when LLMNR fails to find a host
* ‚ò†Ô∏è mDNS may be used when both LLMNR and NBT-NS failed

Both protocols are vulnerable to multiple attacks such as spoofing.

## LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning Remediation üõ°Ô∏è

The best remediation is to disable both protocols, but in some environments, it may not be possible without impacting existing tools.

We can try to send fake LLMNR or NBT-NS requests, and if an host respond, then it's most malicious and we need to investigate.

We must ensure that both stay disabled, such as by monitoring `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient`.

We can try to implement `Network Access Control (NAC)`.
