Account discovery is a self-made name to categorize techniques to find users that have an account of the website.

* 🐟 Try digging in the API (if any)
* 👀 Try testing emails in the password forgot page
* 🙌 Try testing emails in the register page

During the exploitation, we may try to brute force these accounts. We may also try other techniques such as SQL truncation, according to what we discovered.
