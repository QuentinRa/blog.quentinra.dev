# Final step - Post-exploitation

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Post-exploitation ✈️ is the last step of the pentester activities. Once we got access to the target, and escalated to administrator, we are trying to **maintain** and **expand** our access to other machines.

Pivoting to another victim is called **lateral movement** 🔓.

#### 💰 Stealing data/credentials on Windows 🔑

You can hunt for more [secrets](/cybersecurity/red-team/s4.privesc/index.md#credential-hunting) now that you have more privileges, but the process is the same.

You can refer to [Windows Pentester Notes](/operating-systems/windows/security/index.md#windows-pentester-notes-) to dump the the SAM database, DPAPI keys, Kerberos tickets, etc.

Create a new local user.

```ps
PS > net user <username> <password> /add
```

Add a user in the local administrator group.

```ps
PS > net localgroup administrators <username> /add
```

[![windows_privilege_escalation](../../_badges/htb/windows_privilege_escalation.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-privilege-escalation)

On hosts connected to active directory, folders such as `%APPDATA%` are shared between machines. If we add a program in `USERPROFILE\AppData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`, then it will be executed when the users log in.
