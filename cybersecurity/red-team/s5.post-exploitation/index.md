# Final step - Post-exploitation

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Post-exploitation ✈️ is the last step of the pentester activities. Once we got access to the target, and escalated to administrator, we are trying to **maintain** and **expand** our access to other machines.

Pivoting to another victim is called **lateral movement** 🔓.

**Common activities** 🤖

* 🚪 Leave a backdoor (persistence)
* 🙊 Deface the public website
* 🕸️ Redirect users to a malicious website
</div><div>

* 💰 Stealing data <small>(files, photos, emails, source code...)</small>
* 🔑 Stealing credentials <small>(authentication tokens, password, keepass)</small>
* 🌋 Mess with timestamp/... to complicate forensics
* 🧹 Cleanup logs
* ⌨️ installing keyloggers
* 🧨 Edit software configurations/users permissions
* 🐲 Reset user passwords to access their account
