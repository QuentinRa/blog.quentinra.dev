#### DNS records lookup

You can use the commands [nslookup](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/dns.md#nslookup-ipdomain-lookup)/[dig](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/dns.md#dig-ipdomain-lookup) to query DNS servers. You can also use the website [DNS dumpster](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/dns.md#dnsdumpster-domains-lookup), to find both domains and subdomains.

You can also check [DNSRecon](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/tools/dnsrecon.md), but it's mainly used during discovery.

#### WHOIS

You can use [whois](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/dns.md#whois-domain-registrar-data) to dig for registrar information.

#### Certificate Transparency

[![subdomainenumeration](../../../_badges/thmp/subdomainenumeration.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/subdomainenumeration)

Another popular way to find subdomains is to study the generated certificate. A SSL certificate is generate for usually multiple domains, so we may find subdomains or other domains like this.

See [SSL Tools](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/ssl-tls.md#find-certificates-given-a-domain) such as `crt.sh`.
