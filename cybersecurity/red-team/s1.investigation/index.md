<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Investigation 🔎, a.k.a. passive recon <small>(reconnaissance)</small> 🕊️ is the **first** step of the pentester activities.

It involves gathering information about the target from afar 👓️, meaning with **no direct interaction with the target** 👀.

**Goal/Objectives** 🎯: find as much as possible

* 🧑‍💻 Learn more about the company <small>(roles, services...)</small>, the programming languages and software they use...

* 🐟 Find a potential attack vector

* 🧑 Find information about their employees, their emails, their social accounts, their leaked passwords...

* ...

➡️ You can also **infer** data, for instance, if a company has many customers, then they may have a support page/customer service.
