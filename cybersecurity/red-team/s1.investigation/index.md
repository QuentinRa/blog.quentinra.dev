Investigation 🔎, a.k.a. passive recon (reconnaissance) is the first step of the pentester activities.

It involves gathering information about the target from afar 👓️, meaning with **no direct interaction with the target** 👀.

🌱 The goal is to find as much information as possible.

🚿️ You can also infer data, for instance, if a company has many customers, then they may have a support page/customer service.
