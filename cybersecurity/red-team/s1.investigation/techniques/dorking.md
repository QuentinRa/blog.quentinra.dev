Search engines are using bots, called **crawlers** to index websites. They go from one page to another, or from one website to another, by following links. The file **robots.txt** is listing the pages that "good" crawlers shouldn't index, along with the path to a file called **sitemap** which is literally a map of every page/resource of the websites, allowing crawlers to easily crawl the website.

Most search engines, Google being the most famous one, allow us to make **advanced queries**. This was known as advanced search, but some authors populazied the term **Google Dorking**.

ðŸ‘‰ For Google, there is the [advanced search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search) page to make advanced queries, while you may also directly use special tokens in your search bar. There you can find a [long list of Google Search Operators](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/).

ðŸ“Œ [See Google Hacking Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) for juicy queries to exploit this.
