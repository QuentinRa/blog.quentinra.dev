It's possible that some medias such as USB keys are connect to the host. Look in `/media` for any of them.

```shell!
$ ls /media -lah
$ cat /proc/mounts | grep media
```

The second command will display the block device file associated with the mounted media [partition](/operating-systems/linux/env/files/index.md#edit-a-filesystem).

As this is a file, we can use grep to fix interesting strings on it. We can also dump it to [analyze it](/cybersecurity/blue-team/topics/forensics.md) using either:

```shell!
$ sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/tmp/data.bin bs=4M
$ sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sdb of=/tmp/data.bin
```
