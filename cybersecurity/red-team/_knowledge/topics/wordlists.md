# Red-Team Wordlists ‚õ™

[![passwordattacks](../../../_badges/thmp/passwordattacks.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/passwordattacks)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Wordlists are files with one item per line, usually, a word.

They are mainly used to automate tasks. For instance, to perform a password attack, we will most likely use a wordlist will a list of usernames to test, and a password wordlist with common passwords.

* üèùÔ∏è Find common (+hidden) directories on a web server
* üîë Test common passwords
* ü•∑ Find hidden form parameters, headers, etc.
* ...

CTFs are usually using the infamous `rockout.txt` for passwords  <small>(from the data breach of rockyou.com in 2009)</small>.
</div><div>

[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) <small>(61.4k ‚≠ê)</small> is the most popular place to find wordlists.

```shell!
$ sudo apt-get install seclists
/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top10000.txt
/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt
...
```

On Kali, we can install the package [wordlists](https://github.com/drtychai/wordlists) <small>(0.2k ‚≠ê)</small> to access the most common wordlists excluding SecLists wordlists.

```shell!
$ sudo apt-get install wordlists
$ wordlists  # extract rockyou.txt, press Y
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/best1050.txt
/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/best110.txt
...
```

Finally, `payloadsallthethings` contains some wordlists.

#### Simple wordlists

```shell!
$ seq 0 100 > 0_to_100.lst        # 0 1 2 3 4
$ seq 0 2 100 > even_0_to_100.lst # 0 2 4 etc.
$ echo {A..Z} | tr ' ' '\n' > AZ.lst
$ echo user{0..9} | tr ' ' '\n' > user_0_to_9.lst
$ echo {admin,adm,user} | tr ' ' '\n' > simple_list.lst
```

You can also use: [JohnTheReaper](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/cracking/john.md#wordlist-generation) or [hashcat](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/cracking/hashcat.md#wordlist-generation)!

#### CeWL wordlist generation

[![cyberweek2021](../../../_badges/thm/cyberweek2021.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/cyberweek2021)

Users may generate a password based on the environment they are in. [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) <small>(2.2k ‚≠ê)</small> will scrap their website to generate a list of words.  

```ps
$ cewl -w output.lst -d depth -m word_size URL
$ cewl -w output.lst -d depth -m word_size -e URL
$ cewl -w output.lst -m5 --lowercase URL
```

<br>

#### crunch wordlist generation

crunch is a tool on debian to generate wordlists.

```shell!
$ crunch minlength maxlength charset -o crunch.txt # BIG
$ crunch [...] -t pattern
$ crunch [...] -d 1 # "aa" "aaa" etc. are not allowed
```

<br>

#### cook wordlist generation

[cook](https://github.com/glitchedgitz/cook) <small>(1.2k ‚≠ê)</small> is a tool/engine to create wordlists, sort of like a recipe.

```shell!
$ cook [...]
```

<br>

#### Linkedin2Username

[linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) <small>(1.4k ‚≠ê)</small> uses **your** Linkedin account to explore the target Linkedin pages and generate a wordlist of usernames.
</div><div>

#### CUPP wordlist generation

[cupp](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp) <small>(4.7k ‚≠ê, 2020 ü™¶)</small> is a python script that generates a wordlist based on the information you gathered about the target.

```shell!
$ sudo apt-get install cupp
$ cupp -i
```

Even if you gathered a lot of information, you may want to start with small wordlist first.

<br>

#### hashcat utilities

hashcat has a few utilities that it uses to generate wordlists:

* [maskprocessor](https://github.com/hashcat/maskprocessor): generate wordlists from a mask
* [kwprocessor](https://github.com/hashcat/kwprocessor): generate wordlists with keyboard walks
* [princeprocessor](https://github.com/hashcat/princeprocessor): generate wordlists using the PRINCE algorithm

<br>

#### Python

All-purpose knife.

```shell!
$ python -c "s=0; n=200; wordlist = ['a'*i for i in range(1+s, s+n+1)]; print('\n'.join(wordlist))"
a
aa
...
```

<br>

#### Random Tools

* [TTPassGen](https://github.com/tp7309/TTPassGen) <small>(0.2k ‚≠ê)</small>: generate password wordlists
* [pnwgen](https://github.com/toxydose/pnwgen) <small>(0.1k ‚≠ê, 2021 ü™¶)</small>: generate phone number wordlists
* [lyricpass](https://github.com/initstring/lyricpass) <small>(0.1k ‚≠ê, 2019 ü™¶)</small>: generate song lyrics wordlists
* [mentalist](https://github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist) <small>(1.8k ‚≠ê, 2017 ü™¶)</small>: generate password wordlists

## Tune wordlists

[![passwordattacks](../../../_badges/thmp/passwordattacks.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/passwordattacks)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

If the minimum length for a password is 6 characters, we may want to remove shorter passwords. This is something we can easily do using [regexes](/tools-and-frameworks/knowledge/regex/index.md). For instance, to only keep four letters passwords:

```shell!
$ egrep '^.{4}$' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > /tmp/4rock.lst
```

We can also merge, remove duplicates, or sort words:

```shell!
$ cat wordlist1 wordlist2 wordlist3 > wordlist123
$ sort wordlist123 > swordlist    # sort
$ uniq -u swordlist > uwordlist   # duplicates
```

‚ö†Ô∏è To remove duplicates, you must sort the list first.
</div><div>

Chain greps when you need "at least one" of something.

```shell!
$ grep "^.{20}$" wordlist | grep "[A-Z]" # 20 chars, at least one upper
```

It's worth mentioning again that tools such as [JohnTheReaper](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/cracking/john.md#wordlist-generation) or [hashcat](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/cracking/hashcat.md#wordlist-generation) have the capabilities to perform some  operations.
