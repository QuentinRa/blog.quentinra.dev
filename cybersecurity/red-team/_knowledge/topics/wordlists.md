# Red-Team Wordlists ⛪

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Wordlists are files with one item per line, usually, a word.

They are mainly used to automate tasks. For instance, to perform a password attack, we will most likely use a wordlist will a list of usernames to test, and a password wordlist with common passwords.

* 🏝️ Find common (+hidden) directories on a web server
* 🔑 Test common passwords
* 🥷 Find hidden form parameters, headers, etc.
* ...

CTFs are usually using the infamous `rockout.txt` for passwords  <small>(from the data breach of rockyou.com in 2009)</small>. For default passwords, you might want to check out [cirt](https://cirt.net/passwords), [default-password](https://default-password.info/), and [data recovery](https://datarecovery.com/rd/default-passwords/).

[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) (50.6k ⭐) is the most popular place to find wordlists.

```shell!
$ sudo apt-get install seclists
/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top10000.txt
/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt
...
```

On Kali, we can install the package [wordlists](https://github.com/drtychai/wordlists) (0.1k ⭐) to access the most common wordlists excluding SecLists wordlists.

```shell!
$ sudo apt-get install wordlists
$ wordlists  # extract rockyou.txt, press Y
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/best1050.txt
/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/best110.txt
...
```

## Custom Wordlists

#### Simple wordlists

```shell!
$ seq 0 99 > 0_to_99.lst
$ echo {A..Z} | tr ' ' '\n' > AZ.lst
$ echo user{0..9} | tr ' ' '\n' > user_0_to_9.lst
$ echo {admin,adm,user} | tr ' ' '\n' > simple_list.lst
```

You can also use: [JohnTheReaper](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/cracking/john.md#wordlist-generation) or [hashcat](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/cracking/hashcat.md#wordlist-generation)!

#### CeWL wordlist generation

Users may generate a password based on the environment they are in. [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) <small>(1.6k ⭐)</small> will scrap their website to generate a list of words.  

```ps
$ cewl -w output.lst -d depth -m word_size URL
```

## Tune wordlists

[![passwordattacks](../../../_badges/thmp/passwordattacks.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/passwordattacks)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

If the minimum length for a password is 6 characters, we may want to remove shorter passwords. This is something we can easily do using [regexes](/tools-and-frameworks/knowledge/regex/index.md). For instance, to only keep four letters passwords:

```shell!
$ egrep '^.{4}$' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > /tmp/4rock.lst
```

We can also merge, remove duplicates, or sort words:

```shell!
$ cat wordlist1 wordlist2 wordlist3 > wordlist123
$ sort wordlist123 > swordlist    # sort
$ uniq -u swordlist > uwordlist   # duplicates
```

⚠️ To remove duplicates, you must sort the list first.

If worth mentioning again that tools such as [JohnTheReaper](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/cracking/john.md#wordlist-generation) or [hashcat](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/cracking/hashcat.md#wordlist-generation) may have the capabilities to perform these operations.
