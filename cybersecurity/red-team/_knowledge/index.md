The offensive team, also known as the red team 📕, is the team that attack the company, in a pre-defined scope, to help them harden their systems and processes.

* 🔎 Look for vulnerabilities (bugs, loopholes, processes)
* 💥 Try to exploit them
* 💰 Suggest patches/measures to mitigate each vulnerability

It requires someone to be knowledgeable about

* 🌍 **Web**: HTML/CSS/JS/Node/PHP
* 🗃️ **DataBases**: SQL/NoSQL/PLSQL
* 📶 **Networking**: Bash/PowerShell/Network
* ☁️ **Cloud**: docker/...
* ...

There are 3 kind of penetration tests, and according to the type of knowledge you have, you will test different things:

* ⬛ **Black box**: No knowledge about the target 
* 🌫️ **Grey box**: A partial knowledge about the target 
* ⬜ **White box**: A complete knowledge  about the target
</div><div>

Some jobs in the red team are:

* **Red Teamer**: play the hacker, and provide feedback from an enemy perspective. They are testing the company response.
* **Penetration tester**: Try to find vulnerabilities in a system, a network, or an application. Perform security assessments, and audits. Recommend actions to prevent attacks.
* **Security Engineer**: implement, and maintain security controls, handle threats protection... to help prevent cyberattacks, and protect data.

When working with a client, both the penetration tester and the system owner will define **Rules of Engagement (ROE)**

* 🎯 The scope of the test <small>(servers)</small>
* 🤠 The rules of the test <small>(techniques allowed)</small> 
* ...

Everything outside the scope is illegal. See [SANS ROE template](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/).
