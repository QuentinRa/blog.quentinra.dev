On the remote target server, you need to get `chisel`

* Use `lscpu` to find which binary is appropriate
* Download the appropriate binary [here](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/)
* Unzip (`gunzip xxx.gz`) and upload it on the target

Using the configuration below, `http://localhost:8080` on Kali will show the website on port `80` of the remote target server:

```ps
$ ./chisel client host_ip:port_a R:8080:localhost:80
```
