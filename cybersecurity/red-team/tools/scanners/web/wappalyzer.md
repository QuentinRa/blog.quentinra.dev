[wappalyzer](https://github.com/wappalyzer/wappalyzer) <small>(<s>8.1k ‚≠ê</s>, privatised)</small> is common tool used to identify frameworks, libraries, and other components along with their versions. It can be installed as a browser extension or used via their [website](https://www.wappalyzer.com/). 

If you are using the extension, you might want to uncheck the option to send anonymous data to their website.

ü™¶ It seems that their tool became more limited for free users after they deleted the open-source repository.

There is an extension that we recommend to install.
