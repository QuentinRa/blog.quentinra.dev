[wappalyzer](https://github.com/wappalyzer/wappalyzer) <s>(8.1k ‚≠ê)</s> is common tool to find frameworks, and their versions. It can be installed as a browser extension or used via their [website](https://www.wappalyzer.com/). If you are using the extension, you might want to uncheck the option to send anonymous data to their website.

It seems that they removed their open-source GIT, and the tool became since then more limited for free users.
