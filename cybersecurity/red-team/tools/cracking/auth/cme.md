[CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) <small>(8.0k ‚≠ê)</small> is an open-source tool originally developed by [Porchetta Industries](https://porchetta.industries/#tools). It is mainly used to brute force network services passwords such as [SMB](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/smb.md).
