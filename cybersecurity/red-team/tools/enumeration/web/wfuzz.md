[wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz) (5.4k ‚≠ê) is a [Fuzzing](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/websites/fuzzing.md) tool in Python. There are new modern alternatives, and it has not been updated since 2020.

Examples

```ps
$ wfuzz -w wordlist URL/account?id=FUZZZ        # GET
$ wfuzz -w wordlist -d "xxx=FUZZ" URL/login.php # POST
# ...
```

You can add some verbose with `-v`

```ps
$ wfuzz [...] -v
```

You can filter responses by code. `-h` will hide a response based on a criterion... And, `-s`, which is working the same, will do the opposite, and only show a response matching a criterion.

* `c code`: show/hide responses with this return code
* `l n`: show/hide responses with this $n$ number of lines
* `w n`: show/hide responses with this $n$ number of words
* `c n`: show/hide responses with this $n$ number of characters
* `s regex`: show/hide responses containing the regex

```ps
# ignore 404,500
$ wfuzz -w wordlist --hc 404,500 xxx.tld/account?id=FUZZ
# show only 200
$ wfuzz -w wordlist --sc 200 xxx.tld/account?id=FUZZ
```
