# Sublist3r

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

[Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) <small>(10.2k ⭐, 2020 🪦)</small> is a Python tool to passively or actively <small>(using -b and -t)</small> look for subdomains. 

```shell!
$ sudo apt install -y sublist3r
$ sublist3r -d example.com -t 3 -e bing
```

It seems the tool doesn't work anymore as of 2024.
