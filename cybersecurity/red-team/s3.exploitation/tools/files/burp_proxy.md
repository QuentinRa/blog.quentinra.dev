# Burp Proxy

[![burpsuitebasics](../../../../_badges/thm/burpsuitebasics.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuitebasics)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

This is Burp **core** module. It's used to intercept requests <small>(and responses if enabled)</small>. Once intercepted, then can be sent to other modules, such as the intruder, or the repeater. 

First, you must configure your browser to send requests to Burp.

* **Solution 1**: Use burp preconfigured chromium web browser
* **Solution 2** ‚úÖ: Add the "foxyproxy" plugin to your browser
* **Solution 3**: change any settings (browser...) to redirect your browser requests `127.0.0.1:8080`
</div><div>

<details class="details-n">
<summary>Configuration foxyproxy</summary>

* Click on the plugin | options
* Create a new config with title=Burp, Proxy IP: 127.0.0.1, and Port: 8080

Now, when you click on the plugin, and then the configuration, any request will be sent to Burp. It also means that when enabled, you "can't" browser your pages unless you allow the request to be sent in burp suite. Click on the plugin, and "turn off" the plugin when you are done.

<summary>Configuration SSL (avoid an error for HTTPS websites)</summary>

Aside from solution 1, regardless of the mean you used to redirect requests, it won't with HTTPS requests. There is documentation as to how you should fix it [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/external-browser-config/certificate).

* Intercept must be on in Burp Suite
* Go to `http://burpsuite/` | Click on "CA". Alternatively, you can use `http://burp/cert`.
* Add the CA to your browser, as explained in the doc. For Firefox
  * Go to settings | search certificates
  * View certificates
  * Import the downloaded certificate
  * Check "Trust this CA to identify websites"
  * Done

## Proxy tab

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

![burp_suite_proxy_tab](../../_images/burp_suite_proxy_tab.png)

Click on **intercept is on** to intercept requests. The web page will keep loading until you unblock the request ‚ö†Ô∏è.

<br>

* **You may manually edit the request**

If you do that, note that the URL is **URL-encoded**, meaning that some characters that cannot be used in a URL are encoded so that they don't break the URL.

You can select your payload, and use `CTRL+U` to URL-encode it. Use `CTRL+SHIFT+U` to decode it.

* **Right-click on the request to send it to another module**

You can send it to the intruder, repeater... You can also specifically ask Burp suite to catch the response for this request, with "Do intercept > Response to this request".

<br>

* **Forward (CTRL+F) the request, modified, or not, to the server**

<br>

* **Drop the request**

## Scoping

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

We **commonly** define a scope to avoid intercepting uninteresting traffic. Only requests/responses within the scope are intercepted.

* ‚û°Ô∏è Go to the "Proxy" tab
* üêü Intercept a request from your target and click on "Forward"
* ‚û°Ô∏è Go to the "Target" tab
* üé£ Right-click on the target to add to the scope, and add it
* ü´ß Answer "yes" when prompted to disable out-of-scope logs.
* ‚û°Ô∏è Go back to the "Proxy" tab
* ‚û°Ô∏è Click on the subtab "Options"
* üï∏Ô∏è Enable "AND URL is in target scope"

You can also enable **responses** in the same way, but you have to first select "Intercept responses based on [...]".

<details class="details-n">
<summary>Proxy: Intercept JavaScript</summary>

You may want to intercept a JavaScript file to edit the code before sending it to the browser. They are not caught by default.

* In Intercept Client Requests, edit and remove `^js$` from the list of filtered extensions.
* Clear your browser cache
* Do the request loading the JavaScript you want to intercept again
