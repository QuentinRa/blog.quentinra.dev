The proxy is the core module. It's used to intercept requests <small>(and responses if enabled)</small>. Once intercepted, then can be sent to other modules, such as the intruder, or the repeater. But, first, you must configure your browser to send requests to Burp.

* **Solution 1**: Use burp preconfigured Chromium web browser
* **Solution 2** üìå: Add the "foxyproxy" plugin to your browser
* **Solution \***: change any settings (browser...) to redirect your browser requests `127.0.0.1:8080`

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Configuration foxyproxy</summary>

* Click on the plugin | options
* Create a new config with title=Burp, Proxy IP: 127.0.0.1, and Port: 8080

Now, when you click on the plugin, and then the configuration, any request will be sent to Burp. It also means that when enabled, you "can't" browser your pages unless you allow the request to be sent in burp suite. Click on the plugin, and "turn off" the plugin when you are done.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Configuration SSL (avoid an error for HTTPS websites)</summary>

Aside from solution 1, regardless of the mean you used to redirect requests, it won't with HTTPS requests. There is documentation as to how you should fix it [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/external-browser-config/certificate).

* Intercept must be on in Burp Suite
* Go to `http://burpsuite/` | Click on "CA". Alternatively, you can use `http://burp/cert`.
* Add the CA to your browser, as explained in the doc. For Firefox
    * Go to settings | search certificates
    * View certificates
    * Import the downloaded certificate
    * Check "Trust this CA to identify websites"
    * Done

Click on **intercept is on** to intercept requests. The web page will keep loading until you unblock the request ‚ö†Ô∏è.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>You may manually edit the request</summary>

If you do that, note that the URL is **URL-encoded**, meaning that some characters that cannot be used in a URL are encoded so that they don't break the URL.

You can select your payload, and use `CTRL+U` to URL-encode it. Use `CTRL+SHIFT+U` to decode it.
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Right-click on the request to send it to...</summary>

You can send it to the intruder, repeater...

You can also specifically ask Burp suite to catch the response for this request, with "Do intercept > Response to this request".
</details>

<p class="border border-dark p-3">
<b>Forward (CTRL+F) the request, modified, or not, to the server</b>

**Scoping**

Usually, to avoid receiving too much traffic, you will define a scope. Then, you can set up things so that Burp only catches requests/responses being in this scope. First, intercept a request, a forward it.

Now, go to the tab "Targets". Select your target, right-click on it, and add it to the scope. Answer "yes" when prompted to disable out-of-scope logs.

Go back to the proxy tab, then go to options. Here, you can check "AND URL is in target scope". Now, burp will only intercept requests in the scope.

> **Note**: In target, you will also be able to see Burp "sitemap" of the website, along with Issues definitions, which are unused in the community version, but may be a reference when looking for attacks.

**Responses**

If you are interested in responses, be sure to check "intercept responses [...]", and you can also check "AND URL is in target scope".

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Proxy: Intercept JavaScript</summary>

You may want to intercept a JavaScript file to edit the code before sending it to the browser. Burp Suite does not catch JavaScript by default.

* In Intercept Client Requests, edit and remove `^js$` from the list of filtered extensions.
* Clear your browser cache
  Do the request loading the JavaScript you want to intercept again
