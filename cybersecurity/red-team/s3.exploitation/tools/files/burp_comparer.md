## Comparer

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div class="align-self-center">

Be it requests or responses, sometimes, they are too long or too complex for us to see manually what changed between them. Sometimes, even for short requests, we may notice that some stuff has changed like headers.

In any case, if you want to compare requests/responses, the comparer is useful for that. So you can send a request to it from the proxy, the repeater...

In Orange, you can see the two values that will be compared. In each box you can select between the values that are not disabled (greyed).

Once you picked your two values, simply press **Words** or **Bytes** in the bottom left of the screen to process the comparison.

*Random dark mode user note: their dark mode is making this tab hard to use, so I switched back for the capture... It hurts my eyes too ðŸ˜­*
