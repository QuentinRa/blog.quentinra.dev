The repeater is very useful when there is a need to send a usually complex request multiple times with little changes in-between.

Some usual use cases are when trying injections manually, such as SQL injections, or command injections.

Once a request is caught, send it to the repeater. You can use <kbd>CTRL+R</kbd>.

**Notes**

* You have one tab per request.

* Edit the request, URL encode it if needed (CTRL+U), and send it

* There is an inspector on the left, for those that do not want to edit the request manually
