This is like the Burp Suite version of the famous CyberChef, in which you can enter something, and ask Burp Suite to encode/decode it. You can chain encoding/decoding, and you can also hash your input.

There is a button "smart decode", which is like CyberChief magik, which tries to find the encoding, and decode it.

Notice that texts are highlighted/colored with the color of the transformation applied to them to generate the text below. For instance, `"Hello, World"` is in yellow, which means that I used "encode | base64" to generate `SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxk`, while the latter is highlighted in yellow to indicate that I used "decode | base64" to generate the `"Hello, World"` below.
