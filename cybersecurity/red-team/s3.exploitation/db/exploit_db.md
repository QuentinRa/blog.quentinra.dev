**Description** üçÅ

[Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) is a popular website to find exploitable CVEs with their PoC. There is a command-line version called [searchsploit](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb) (7.6k ‚≠ê).

Search for an exploit given keywords:

```shell!
$ searchsploit WordPress wpDiscuz # search
WordPress Plugin wpDiscuz 7.0.4 - Remote C | php/webapps/49967.py
$ searchsploit -p 49967 # locate
Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/49967.py
$ # copy, then edit, and use    
$ cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/49967.py /tmp/49967.py
```

Some exploits may be old, poorly documented, and need to be tuned before use, but that's not something exclusive to exploit db.

If searchsploit is not installed, try:

```ps
$ sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```
