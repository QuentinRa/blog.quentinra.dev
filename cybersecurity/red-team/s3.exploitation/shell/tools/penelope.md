For Windows hosts, it doesn't do anything special nor any shell upgrades, as Windows is not supported. You would rather use a [metasploit handler](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/frameworks/metasploit/_files/msf_handler.md) instead.

On Kali, it may be more appropriate to install it like this:

```ps
$ cd /opt
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/brightio/penelope.git
$ sudo ln -s /opt/penelope/penelope.py /usr/local/bin/penelope
$ penelope 4444
```
