# Bind shell

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A bind shell is similar to a [reverse shell](reverse_shell.md) aside from the fact that the server, i.g. the one waiting for clients, is now the target, and the hacker is the one connecting to it.

It's a backdoor, as anyone connecting to it can run commands, and the shell will keep running even if the client leaves.
