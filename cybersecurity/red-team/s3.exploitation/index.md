Exploitation 💥 is the third step of the pentester activities. We attempt to exploit a vulnerability discovered during investigation.

Some activities are:

* 🔑 Brute forcing credentials
* 💀 Exploiting a known (unpatched) vulnerability
  * in a service
  * in an application
  * in a website/an api
  * ...
* ...

📌 The goal is to get a **remote access to the target**.
</div><div>

Vulnerabilities can be categorized in 5 categories:

* 🪸 Operating System
* 🔥 Misconfigurations <small>(Version Disclosure, Sensitive Data Exposure, Security Misconfigurations)</small>
* 🔏 Weak credentials
* 😎 Logic flaws <small>(Insecure Deserialization)</small>
* 🧑 Human errors

Note that not all vulnerabilities are exploitable, and not all vulnerabilities have a public exploit to exploit them.

## Vulnerability databases

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

#### Vulnerabilities identifiers

To identify and classify vulnerabilities, you can use:

* 📌 **CVE** <small>(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)</small> is a dictionary of every known vulnerability. The format is **CVE-YEAR-ID**.

* 📝 **CWE** <small>(Common Weakness Enumeration)</small> is a list of common weaknesses in applications, grouped in categories.

<br>

#### Vulnerability scoring

There are 2 well-known systems to rank vulnerabilities.

* 🍀 **CVSS** <small>(Common Vulnerability Scoring System)</small> which was released in 2005, and is free and open-source. [A CVE is ranked from 0 to 10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator).

* 💵 **VPR** <small>(Vulnerability Priority Rating)</small> is a modern way based on the risk for the organization that uses it. It ranges from 0 to 100.

<br>

#### Proof Of Concept

When a vulnerability is discovered, a proof of concept (**PoC**) may be written to demonstrate that the vulnerability is exploitable. As a pentester, you may look for them to exploit a vulnerability.

➡️ Use GitHub, GitLab, and Google to look for them...
</div><div>

There are **many** vulnerability databases. You should use 2-3 as they may have different information <small>(community info, list of exploits...)</small>.

* [Exploit DB](db/exploit_db.md) - CVE with exploits

* [Attacker KB](db/attacker_kb.md) - community reviews

* [CVE details](db/cve_details.md) - every CVE

* [CVE.ORG (MITRE)](db/cve_org.md) - every CVE

* [Snyk](db/snyk.md) - focus on web applications

* [Rapid7](db/rapid7.md) - a bit of focus on metasploit

* [Circl](db/circl.md) - simplified information for each CVE

* [NVD](db/nvd.md) - NIST vulnerability database (NVD)

* [MSRC](db/msrc.md) - Microsoft CVEs

* [vulners](db/vulners.md) - Vulnerabilty search engine

* [Trickest/CVE](db/trickest_cve.md) - CVE + PoC

* [CVEList](db/cvelist.md) - GIT with every CVE

* [InTheWild](db/inthewild.md) - CVE used in the "wild"

* [cxsecurity](https://cxsecurity.com/) - CVE with exploits

* [packetstormsecurity](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/tags/exploit/) - CVE with exploits

```
=> file permission (root)
UNION ALL SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd')--
UNION SELECT "<? system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>" INTO OUTFILE
```

Auth

* bruteforce
* insecure passwords
* (un|badly)encrypted passwords
* vulnerable reset password (easy reset questions)
* auth token in URL
* failure when logging with google (can find the "default" password)
* default accounts/...

Networking

* Cain and abel
* Ettercap
</div><div>

Security questions

* must be fixed
* straightforward/easy to remember
* must be encrypted

XXE

* API SOAP (DTD)
* Configuration to disable XXE
* File Upload (network request)
* [Email_injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_injection)
* [HTTP_header_injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_header_injection)
* [Session_fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation)
* Pass-The-Hash Attack
* BREACH attacks/CRIME attacks

RR

* Malicious iFrames
* HTTP 302 Redirect (Open Redirect?)

Tools

* Python to transfer files
* Truncating wordlists
* Website to generate shells
* ➡️ `weevely3` for web shells
* ➡️ `penelope`/`pwncat-cs`/`pwncat` to catch shells
* `ffuf`/`wfuzz`: for fuzzing
* `gobuster`/`dirsearch`: for forced browsing
* `ffuf`/`wfuzz`/`hydra`: brute force forms
* `gobuster`/`ffuf`: virtual hosts/subdomains
* BurpSuite to catch/repeat/... requests

R2

* Misconfigurations: tools to detect them (default account/password, not updated, unnecessary services/... enabled, too much in errors, no documentation of measures, no isolation)
* KeePass KbDx
* Insecure deserialization (example: DoS an API taking a non-primitive type such as a JSON with a regular expression)
