<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Exploitation üí• is the third step of the pentester activities. We attempt to exploit a vulnerability discovered during investigation.

Some activities are:

* üîë Brute forcing credentials
* üíÄ Exploiting a known (unpatched) vulnerability
  * in a service
  * in an application
  * in a website/an api
  * ...
* ...

üìå The goal is to get **remote access to the target**.
</div><div>

You will usually look for an unpatched vulnerability, and try to exploit it to upload or run commands to create a remote shell.

Vulnerabilities can be categorized in 5 categories:

* ü™∏ Operating System
* üî• Misconfigurations <small>(Version Disclosure, Sensitive Data Exposure, Security Misconfigurations)</small>
* üîè Weak credentials
* üòé Logic flaws <small>(Insecure Deserialization)</small>
* üßë Human errors

Note that not all vulnerabilities are exploitable, and not all vulnerabilities have a public exploit to exploit them.

## Exploiting Developer Files

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Version Control Files Disclosure ‚úçÔ∏è

Developers commonly use [version control system](/tools-and-frameworks/vcs/_general/index.md) to back up and manage the changes in the code. These may be exposed.

* [Exposed GIT Folder](/cybersecurity/red-team/s3.exploitation/vulns/disclosure/git/README.md) `[.git]` `[.gitignore]`
* Exposed SVN Folder `[.svn]`

‚ö†Ô∏è We are downloading potentially harmful files. This may lead to your host being compromised <small>(RCE, path traversal, etc.)</small>.
</div><div>

#### Web-Accessible Composer or Package files

[![surfer](../../_badges/thm-p/surfer.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/surfer)

Composer <small>(PHP)</small> or package <small>(Node.js, JavaScript)</small> files can allow attackers to determine the libraries used by the website along their version.

* An exposed `composer.phar` may be dangerous <small>(known exploits)</small>
* An exposed `vendor` folder can be dangerous <small>(vulnerable test files, etc.)</small>

‚úçÔ∏è If it is an environment is production, it is an issue if development packages and utilities are still present.
</div></div>

<hr class="sep-both">

## Exploiting Exposed Header

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

CORS is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers. It prevents websites from making requests <small>(aside from GET)</small> to other websites, unless `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` allows it.

The origin is set by `fetch`/`xhr` <small>(or can be modified from Burp for tests)</small>.

```yaml!
# Ex: Access to /getToken.php (GET)
Host: vulnerable.com
Origin: https://example.com
```

If servers respond with any of these headers, verify if it was intended.

```yaml!
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
```

The latter may be dangerous when used with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` as the client cookie from `vulnerable.com` will be sent along the request to `/getToken.php` <small>(and example gets the token)</small>.

‚ö†Ô∏è This vulnerability doesn't seem to work in modern browsers.

üõ°Ô∏è Only allow trusted origins to access your API.

## Exploiting Query Parameters

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Open Redirect

[![unvalidated_redirects](../../_badges/owasp/unvalidated_redirects.svg)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html)
[![session_security](../../_badges/htb/session_security.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/session-security)
[![http_open_redirect](../../_badges/rootme/web_server/http_open_redirect.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/HTTP-Open-redirect)

Many pages within an application are redirecting the user. This is commonly the case with the `login` and `logout` pages.

```html!
<a href="/logout?path=/home">Logout</a>
```

If the input is not validated enough, we may be able to redirect the user to another website. It can be used for phishing attacks.

Common bypasses are: `//example.com` or `/%2f%2fexample.com`.

üõ°Ô∏è Use an allow list or disable this feature.

## Exploiting Parameters

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Predictable Tokens

[![broken_authentication](../../_badges/htb/broken_authentication.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/broken-authentication)
[![marabout](../../_badges/rootme/realist/marabout.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Realist/Marabout)

Some pages, such as the reset password page or csrf tokens, may use predictable tokens due to their parameters being known.

* ü™ì Some hashing function: `md5(username)`
* ü™¶ Some temporary password based on known data
* üöß Some known values to the user, such as with [CVE-2016-0783](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-0783)

```php!
// vulnerable code logic
$time = intval(microtime(true) * 1000);
$token = md5($username . $time);
```

Most servers are returning a Date Header with the date of the server. We need to brute force the microsecond to find `$time`.

```py
username = 'username'
time_string = "Sat, 04 May 2024 09:35:52 GMT"
format_string = "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z"
dt_object = datetime.datetime.strptime(time_string, format_string)
dt_object = pytz.timezone('GMT').localize(dt_object)
base_epoch_ms = int(dt_object.timestamp() * 1000)
for epoch_ms in range(base_epoch_ms - 1000, base_epoch_ms + 1000 + 1):
    token = hashlib.md5((username + str(epoch_ms)).encode()).hexdigest()
    # test the token
```
</div><div>
</div></div>

<hr class="sep-both">

## Exploit Known Vulnerable Pages

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Exploit Sign-in/Sign-up Pages

[![broken_authentication](../../_badges/htb/broken_authentication.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/broken-authentication)

These pages may be exploited to enumerate accounts on the application. This can increase the likelihood of getting initial access.

* [ ] Check for changes in the sign-in message <small>(delay/error/prefill)</small>
* [ ] Check for changes in the sign-up message <small>(delay/error)</small>
* [ ] Determine the password policy using the sign-up page
* [ ] Check if mail aliases are allowed (`a+b@c.d`)

‚úçÔ∏è For the login page, check the authentication mechanism [section](#exploit-authentication-mechanisms).

#### Exploit Reset Password Pages

[![broken_authentication](../../_badges/htb/broken_authentication.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/broken-authentication)
[![marabout](../../_badges/rootme/realist/marabout.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Realist/Marabout)

This page may be exploited to enumerate accounts on the application. Additionally, the reset password process itself may be vulnerable.

* [ ] Check for changes in the reset message <small>(delay/error)</small>
* [ ] Security questions' responses may be easy to guess
* [ ] Security questions forms may be vulnerable to brute force
* [ ] Reset password tokens should have an expiry
* [ ] Reset password tokens should not be reusable
* [ ] Reset password tokens may be [predictable]()

üìö The [Birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) <small>(many users, two get the same token)</small> or token leakage due to the referrer header are unlikely to be exploitable.
</div><div>

#### Exploit Authentication Mechanisms

[![weak_password](../../_badges/rootme/web_server/weak_password.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/Weak-password)

If we identified a valid account on the website, we may want to investigate if we can force our way in.

* [ ] Check for data leaks associated with the target
* [ ] Check if the sign-in page is unprotected against brute force
* [ ] Test the default credentials for known websites
 website

In last resort, we can try to brute force accounts.

* [TODO] Rate limit, see accounts.md

## Remote shell ‚öì

[![shells_and_payloads](../../_badges/htb/shells_and_payloads.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/shells--payloads)
[![introtoshells](../../_badges/thmp/introtoshells.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells)
[![Reverse Shell](../../_badges/poat/reverse_shell.svg)](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

In CTFs, you will most of the time be able to get a remote shell access to the target, similarily to a SSH access. There is a need for a 

* **server** which is accepting connections <small>(most likely the hacker host)</small> 
* **client** which is connecting to the server <small>(most likely the victim)</small>

There are 3 kind of ways to get a remote shell:

* [Web shell](shell/web_shell.md)
* [Reverse shell](shell/reverse_shell.md)
* [Bind shell](shell/bind_shell.md)

‚û°Ô∏è To avoid alerting IDS, a bind/reverse shell should use a protocol that would not be suspected such as HTTPS (`443`). 

‚ò†Ô∏è Most of the time, bind/reverse shells are blocked by firewalls.

üê∏ See [msfvenom](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/frameworks/metasploit/msfvenom.md) to generate shells, and [msfconsole](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/frameworks/metasploit/_files/msf_handler.md) to catch them.
</div><div>

Most remote shells that we create are instable:

* üò• you can't use commands requiring user input <small>(ex: `sudo`)</small>
* üçÉ You can't clear nor resize your terminal
* ü¶• There is no auto-completion, you can't use arrows...
* ‚õî CTRL+C kill the shell, not the command

We can use a wrapper for the client/server <small>(the one on your machine)</small> to make things really nice, or we can [try to manually patch the shell](shell/manual.md).

* [Penelope wrapper](shell/tools/penelope.md)
* [pwncat wrapper](shell/tools/pwncat.md)
* [rlwrap wrapper](shell/tools/rlwrap.md)
* [socat wrapper](shell/tools/socat.md)

Not every shell can be upgraded <small>(test another client...)</small>. A wrapper, may be available both as client or server depending on what you do.

## Vulnerability databases

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

#### Vulnerabilities identifiers

To identify and classify vulnerabilities, you can use:

* üìå **CVE** <small>(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)</small> is a dictionary of every known vulnerability. The format is **CVE-YEAR-ID**.

* üìù **CWE** <small>(Common Weakness Enumeration)</small> is a list of common weaknesses in applications, grouped in categories.

* See also: [CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org/), [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/), CCE, CPE

<br>

#### Vulnerability scoring

There are 2 well-known systems to rank vulnerabilities.

* üçÄ **CVSS** <small>(Common Vulnerability Scoring System)</small> which was released in 2005, and is free and open-source. It calculated from 3 factors: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. Only the base is shown for a CVE. Use the [calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) to compute your company-specific value.

* üíµ **VPR** <small>(Vulnerability Priority Rating)</small> is a modern way based on the risk for the organization that uses it. It ranges from 0 to 100.

<br>

#### Proof Of Concept

When a vulnerability is discovered, a proof of concept (**PoC**) may be written to demonstrate that the vulnerability is exploitable. As a pentester, you may look for them to exploit a vulnerability.

‚û°Ô∏è Use GitHub, GitLab, and Google to look for them...
</div><div>

There are **many** vulnerability databases. You should use 2-3 as they may have different information <small>(community info, list of exploits...)</small>.

* [**Exploit DB**](db/exploit_db.md) - CVE with exploits
* [Attacker KB](db/attacker_kb.md) - community reviews
* [**CVE details**](db/cve_details.md) - every CVE
* [CVE.ORG (MITRE)](db/cve_org.md) - every CVE
