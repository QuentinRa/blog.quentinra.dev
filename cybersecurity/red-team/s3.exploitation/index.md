Exploitation 💥 is the third step of the pentester activities. We attempt to exploit a vulnerability discovered during investigation.

Some activities are:

* 🔑 Brute forcing credentials
* 💀 Exploiting a known (unpatched) vulnerability
  * in a service
  * in an application
  * in a website/an api
  * ...
* ...

📌 The goal is to get **remote access to the target**.
</div><div>

You will usually look for an unpatched vulnerability, and try to exploit it to upload or run commands to create a remote shell.

Vulnerabilities can be categorized in 5 categories:

* 🪸 Operating System
* 🔥 Misconfigurations <small>(Version Disclosure, Sensitive Data Exposure, Security Misconfigurations)</small>
* 🔏 Weak credentials
* 😎 Logic flaws <small>(Insecure Deserialization)</small>
* 🧑 Human errors

Note that not all vulnerabilities are exploitable, and not all vulnerabilities have a public exploit to exploit them.

## Remote shell ⚓

[![introtoshells](../../_badges/thmp/introtoshells.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells)
[![Reverse Shell](../../_badges/poat/reverse_shell.svg)](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

In CTFs, you will most of the time be able to get a remote shell access to the target, similarily to a SSH access. There is a need for a 

* **server** which is accepting connection <small>(most likely the hacker host)</small> 
* **client** which is connecting to the server <small>(most likely the victim)</small>

There are 3 kind of ways to get a remote shell:

* [Web shell](shell/web_shell.md)
* [Reverse shell](shell/reverse_shell.md)
* Blind shell

➡️ To avoid alerting IDS, a bind/reverse shell should use a protocol that would not be suspected such as HTTPS (`443`). 

🔒 Most of the time, bind/reverse shells are blocked by firewalls.
</div><div>

Most remote shell that we create are instable:

* 😥 you can't use commands requiring user input <small>(ex: `sudo`)</small>
* 🍃 You can't clear nor resize your terminal
* 🦥 There is no auto-completion, you can't use arrows...
* ⛔ CTRL+C kill the shell, not the command

We can use a wrapper for the client/server <small>(the one on your machine)</small> to make things really nice, or we can [try to manually patch the shell](shell/manual.md).

* [Penelope wrapper](shell/penelope.md)
* [pwncat wrapper](shell/pwncat.md)
* [rlwrap wrapper](shell/rlwrap.md)
* [socat wrapper](shell/socat.md)

Not every shell can be upgraded <small>(test another client...)</small>. A wrapper, may be available both as client or server depending on what you do.

## Vulnerability databases

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

#### Vulnerabilities identifiers

To identify and classify vulnerabilities, you can use:

* 📌 **CVE** <small>(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)</small> is a dictionary of every known vulnerability. The format is **CVE-YEAR-ID**.

* 📝 **CWE** <small>(Common Weakness Enumeration)</small> is a list of common weaknesses in applications, grouped in categories.

<br>

#### Vulnerability scoring

There are 2 well-known systems to rank vulnerabilities.

* 🍀 **CVSS** <small>(Common Vulnerability Scoring System)</small> which was released in 2005, and is free and open-source. [A CVE is ranked from 0 to 10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator).

* 💵 **VPR** <small>(Vulnerability Priority Rating)</small> is a modern way based on the risk for the organization that uses it. It ranges from 0 to 100.

<br>

#### Proof Of Concept

When a vulnerability is discovered, a proof of concept (**PoC**) may be written to demonstrate that the vulnerability is exploitable. As a pentester, you may look for them to exploit a vulnerability.

➡️ Use GitHub, GitLab, and Google to look for them...
</div><div>

There are **many** vulnerability databases. You should use 2-3 as they may have different information <small>(community info, list of exploits...)</small>.

* [Exploit DB](db/exploit_db.md) - CVE with exploits

* [Attacker KB](db/attacker_kb.md) - community reviews

* [CVE details](db/cve_details.md) - every CVE

* [CVE.ORG (MITRE)](db/cve_org.md) - every CVE

* [Snyk](db/snyk.md) - focus on web applications

* [Rapid7](db/rapid7.md) - a bit of focus on metasploit

* [Circl](db/circl.md) - simplified information for each CVE

* [NVD](db/nvd.md) - NIST vulnerability database (NVD)

* [MSRC](db/msrc.md) - Microsoft CVEs

* [vulners](db/vulners.md) - Vulnerabilty search engine

* [Trickest/CVE](db/trickest_cve.md) - CVE + PoC

* [CVEList](db/cvelist.md) - GIT with every CVE

* [InTheWild](db/inthewild.md) - CVE used in the "wild"

* [cxsecurity](https://cxsecurity.com/) - CVE with exploits

* [packetstormsecurity](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/tags/exploit/) - CVE with exploits

## Common techniques

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Password cracking 🔑

You may have to crack passwords

* [See hash cracking](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/index.md#hash-cracking) (john/hashcat)
* [See hydra](tools/hydra.md) (brute force services such as ssh/ftp/...)
* [See nmap](../s2.discovery/tools/nmap.md#brute-force-scripts) (uncommon alternative to hydra)

➡️ We usually call it "brute forcing", but it's a dictionary attack using a [wordlist](/cybersecurity/red-team/_knowledge/index.md#wordlists-) such as `rockyou.txt` in most scenarios.
</div><div>

#### Vulnerability exploitation 💀

Use a pre-written script provided by a vulnerability database to exploit a detected exploitable vulnerability.

</div></div>

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Identification and Authentication Failure** 🔑

* The website does not prevent brute force
* The website allows users to use weak passwords
* The website does not encrypt passwords

<br>

**Broken Access Control** 📭 <small>(users can access files/URLs they shouldn't)</small>

* The principle of the least privilege is not applied correctly
* Someone can use someone else token/ID to do...
* A user can access "logged-only" pages without logging in
</div><div>

**Injections** 🪤

* There is insufficient or no validation at all
* There is insufficient or no sanitization at all

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Cryptographic Failures** 🔓

* The server is using clear text
* The server allows/uses HTTP instead of HTTPS
* The server uses a weak cryptographic algorithm
