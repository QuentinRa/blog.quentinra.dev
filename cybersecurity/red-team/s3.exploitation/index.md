Exploitation 💥 is the third step of the pentester activities. We attempt to exploit a vulnerability discovered during investigation.

Some activities are:

* 🔑 Brute forcing credentials
* 💀 Exploiting a known (unpatched) vulnerability
  * in a service
  * in an application
  * in a website/an api
  * ...
* ...
</div><div>

Vulnerabilities can be categorized in 5 categories:

* 🪸 Operating System
* 🔥 (Mis)Configuration <small>(Version Disclosure, Sensitive Data Exposure, Security Misconfigurations)</small>
* 🔏 Weak credentials
* 😎 Logic Flaws <small>(Insecure Deserialization)</small>
* 🧑 Human-Factor

Note that not all vulnerabilities are exploitable, and not all vulnerabilities have a public exploit to exploit them.

## 👻 To-do 👻

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* rootkit, bootkit
* memory leaks
* overflow (change the return pointer in the stack with a parameter that overflow)
* Passive attacks (monitor)
* Active attacks
* `select sql from sqlite_master`
* Server-Side Template Injection
* fault injection
* Preconfigured account with well-known passwords
* password reuse

SQL

* sql truncation attack
* [DSSS](https://github.com/stamparm/DSSS)
* [whitewidow](https://github.com/WhitewidowScanner/whitewidow)

```
=> file permission (root)
UNION ALL SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd')--
UNION SELECT "<? system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>" INTO OUTFILE
```

Auth

* bruteforce
* insecure passwords
* (un|badly)encrypted passwords
* vulnerable reset password (easy reset questions)
* auth token in URL
* failure when logging with google (can find the "default" password)
* default accounts/...

Networking

* Cain and abel
* Ettercap
</div><div>

Security questions

* must be fixed
* straightforward/easy to remember
* must be encrypted

XXE

* API SOAP (DTD)
* Configuration to disable XXE
* File Upload (network request)
