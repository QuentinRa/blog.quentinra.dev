# Framework exploitation

[Go back](../index.md)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Frameworks and CMS such as WordPress make it easier to develop websites by providing a generic implementation of common website features. It's often advised to use a framework both to ease the work of the developers, and reduce the number of vulnerabilities.

Fewer vulnerabilities don't mean that there are no vulnerabilities. They may be misconfigured or misused. They may not be updated or they may have installed vulnerable third-party extensions.

## WordPress

There are two **paid** solutions to attack [WordPress](/programming-languages/web/others/cms/wordpress/index.md): [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/) and [WPScan](https://wpscan.com/). WPScan is providing a CLI tool for **free** and for non-commercial use available [here](https://wpscan.com/wordpress-cli-scanner/) (8.0k ‚≠ê).

```ps
# before every scan, update the local metadata database
$ wpscan --update # may be automatically performed
```

You can enumerate themes, plugins, and usernames.

```ps
# Look into the HTML, /wp-content/themes/... for themes
$ wpscan --url URL -e t
# Look into /wp-content/plugins/pluginname/... for plugins
# Use the README in each plugin to find the version
$ wpscan --url URL -e p
# Find users (look for ID in posts...)
$ wpscan --url URL -e u
```

You can use WPScan/[hydra](../tools/hydra.md#form-brute-force)/... to bruteforce the login form.

```ps
$ wpscan --url URL -p wordlist -u username
$ hydra -l username -P wordlist URL http-form-post '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In&testcookie=1:S=Location' -V
```
</div><div>

You can select a mode between aggressive/passive when scanning. Some results might not be visible according to the mode selected, so you should try both if you can.

```ps
$ wpscan --url URL -e t --plugins-detection aggressive
$ wpscan --url URL -e t --plugins-detection passive
```

The CLI can be unleashed with WPScan API that will retrieve vulnerabilities  when scanning. The limit is 25 requests per day. See [Optional: WordPress Vulnerability Database API](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/wiki/WPScan-User-Documentation#optional-wordpress-vulnerability-database-api). You can also browse vulnerabilities manually: [WordPress](https://wpscan.com/wordpresses), [Plugins](https://wpscan.com/plugins), and [Themes](https://wpscan.com/themes).

```ps
# To list vulnerabilities, add a "v" before the enumerated type
# ex: vulnerable plugins
$ wpscan --url URL -e vp
```
