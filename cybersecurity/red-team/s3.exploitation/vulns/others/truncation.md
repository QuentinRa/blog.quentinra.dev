[SQL Truncation](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection#sql-truncation-attack) is an attack in which we create a string that is too long for the database and is truncated. This could allow us to reset an account password by creating a new account with a username that once truncated match an existing user and a password of our choice.

* Existing username: `admin`
* Maximum length: `32 characters`
* Payload: `admin<32 spaces>a` truncated to `admin`

This attack is not possible anymore in multiple DBMS.
