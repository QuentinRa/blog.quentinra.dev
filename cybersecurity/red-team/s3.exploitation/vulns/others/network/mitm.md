# Man-in-the-middle attack

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

A Man-in-the-middle <small>(M-I-T-M)</small> design an attack where an attacker seats between clients and their target server.

* They fooled the client and made them believe they are the 'server'
* They are able to access and maybe edit/drop every message

The hacker will most likely be able to read hashes or credentials sent over the network allowing them to compromise more accounts 🔑.
