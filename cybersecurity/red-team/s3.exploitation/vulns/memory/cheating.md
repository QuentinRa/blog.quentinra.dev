# Video game cheating

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

A common approach to cheating in video games is **memory manipulation**. At some point, data such as the remaining health is stored in memory. If we can find where, we can edit it, freeze it... ü•á

#### PC games

You can use [Cheat Engine](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/) <small>(11.4k ‚≠ê)</small> is a tool that can be used to manipulate a process memory. Download it, run it, and select the process you want to inspect. You can search for values, and edit them.

Web assembly games are games running in a browser, but originally written in C/C++/... and ported to a browser using "Web assembly".

You can download [Cetus](https://github.com/Qwokka/Cetus) <small>(0.4k ‚≠ê)</small>. Install it as a plugin ([see](/programming-languages/web/topics/extensions/index.md#add-a-local-extension-)). Navigate to the game, open devtools, and open the tab "Cetus".

* If you know the value of something, simply search for it.
* Otherwise, reset the search, then use differential search <small>(leave empty)</small>. Do something, like losing health. Search again while clicking on an option such as LT. The results will be addresses that changed since the last search based on the option. Continue until you find the one that you searched for.

Once you find the memory address, click on the bookmark icon. Navigate to bookmark to see the current value, freeze it...
