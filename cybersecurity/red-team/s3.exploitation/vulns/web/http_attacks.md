# HTTP Requests

There are multiple ways to abuse HTTP requests.

#### HTTP Verb Tampering

If the webserver is misconfigured or the code contains logic flaws, another HTTP method might be accepted while we are denied access with the 'intended' forbidden HTTP methods.

* **Ex**: A website expecting a POST request but using `$_REQUEST` may be vulnerable to injection using GET ([Refer to Logic Flaws](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/websites/logic_flaws.md#php-_request-logic-flaw))

* **Ex**: A website using `.htaccess` to request a password might be misconfigured and bypassed using `GETS` or `PUT` etc.

#### HTTP CRLF Attack

[CRLF Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting) can be used for request smuggling or log corruption. For instance, it may be used to  insert malicious logs.

#### HTTP Request Smuggling

Request Smuggling occurs request that is interpreted as two by the back-end while load-balancers/reverse proxies only saw one request.

When both `Content-Length` <small>(CL)</small> and `Transfer-Encoding` <small>(TE)</small> are present, each solution may interpret differently the size of the request.


ðŸ“š Usage: evade firewalls, cache poisoning, etc.
