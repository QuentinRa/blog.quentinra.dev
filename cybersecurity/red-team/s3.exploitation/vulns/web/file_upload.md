It's common for websites to allow users to upload files such as an avatar. Unfortunately, in some cases, a hacker can upload malicious files such as a script leading to **Remote Code Execution** (RCE).

Usually, most websites have filters, but there are often logic flaws in the filtering, leading to malicious files bypassing them.

There may be JavaScript filters, and to be more efficient while making requests, we usually use tools such as:

* [Burp Suite](../../tools/burp.md) Repeater
* [curl](/operating-systems/linux/commands/list.md#command-curl)

```bash
# submit a file with name=file and value=path/to/file
$ curl -X POST -F "submit:value" -F "file:@path/to/file" URL
```
</div></div>

## Theorical process

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

1. ‚úÖ Upload a valid file<br><span>&nbsp;</span>
2. üîç Look for the folder where the file was uploaded.

<br>

* Try to determine the naming scheme <small>(ex: {time}-{filename}.png)</small>. You may have to use [forced browsing tools](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/forced_browsing.md) if indexing was turned off.
* Try to see the behavior if uploading a file with the same name

<br>

3. ‚õî Try to upload a file that may be rejected<br><span>&nbsp;</span>
</div><div>

4. üîì If it was rejected, try a lot of payloads to see what the filter is using to assess whether a file can/can't be accepted. See the filter evasion section below. **Test your valid file with**
* the extension of the one that was rejected
* the MIME type of the one that was rejected
* the magic number of the one that was rejected
* ...<br><span>&nbsp;</span>

5. üí£ Try testing different file sizes to find the maximum upload size

## Filter evasion

*PHP functions that may be involved: `pathinfo`...*

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

* ‚û°Ô∏è bypass check of the extension being in the filename

```text!
malicious.png.php
```

* ‚û°Ô∏è bypass blacklists/deny list

  * Other extensions that may have been enabled: `.php5`, `.phtml`, `.php2`, `.php3`, `.php4`,`.php7`, `.pht`, `.phps`, `.phar`, `.inc`...
  * Bypass case-sensitive filters, but the server may not execute them: `.pHp`, `.PHP`, `.PHTML`...<small>&nbsp;</small><br><br>

* ‚û°Ô∏è Try the null byte <small>(PHP < 5.3.4)</small>

```text!
malicious.php%00.png -> malicious.php
malicious.php\x00.png -> malicious.php
```

* ‚û°Ô∏è If there is a filter checking for the `<?php` tag, you can try
  * testing if the filter is case-sensitive: `<?PHP`, `<?pHP`...
  * testing  with another variant: `<?="xxx"?>`...

</div><div>

* ‚û°Ô∏è bypass  [MIME-type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) checks by manually editing the `Content-Type` header of your request.

```text!
Content-Type: application/php -> image/png
```

* ‚û°Ô∏è An alternative to editing MIME-type is spoofing the file magic number. Using a command such as `file xxx`, you can see the type of your file. This is done by checking the first bytes of the file for a value called [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures).

```ps
# Ex: use GIFs magic number (6 bytes: 47 49 46 38 37 61)
$ mv xxx.php xxx.gif
$ file script.gif # ASCII text
$ cat script.gif
xxxxxx[...] # added 6 dummy characters at the start
$ hexeditor script.png 
# replace them with the magic number
# 47 49 46 38 37 61
$ file script.gif # GIF
```
</div></div>

## Remediation üßØ

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* Do not use a well-known name for your uploads (`uploads`, `images`...)

* Disable indexing

* Add a limit to the size of uploaded files (ex: in a `.htaccess`)
</div><div>

* Do not expose uploaded files if there is no reason for them to be available to the user. You could also restrict access with a `.htaccess` only allowing the local website to access them.

* Use multiple filters/ways to assess that a file is what you expect.

* Do not rely on HTML/JS filtering, as they can be bypassed
