Path traversal is a vulnerability allowing a hacker will manage to access files/folders that were not supposed to be available for users by exploiting the application.

⚠️ You should avoid using your browser to perform path traversal attacks, as there is no guaranty that what you write is what you send.

For instance, `http://example.com/image-preview.php?url=...` is supposed to display an image given a URL.

You can use the **dot-dot-slash attack**, and give a URL such as `../../../../../etc/passwd`. You can add more `../` than needed.

It's used by others attacks such as [File inclusion](inclusion.md) or [SSRF](ssrf.md).

## Bypass filters

* If there is a function removing `../`, then you can craft a payload that will only work as expected once the input was filtered.

```
Input: ....//
Apply Filter: remove ../
Output: ../
```
