Fundamentally, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) refers to using the session of a user logged to a website to perform API calls without their consent. For instance, an API call to modify their password.

[XSS](/cybersecurity/red-team/s3.exploitation/vulns/web/xss.md) is a common attack technique to perform a CSRF attack.

Many modern browsers have built-in anti-CSRF measures, such as with the `Content-Security-Policy` header.

You can find payloads on [PayloadsAllTheThings/CSRF](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/CSRF%20Injection). You can test the payload with a [HTTP Requests Grabber](/cybersecurity/red-team/_knowledge/topics/request_grabber.md) first during CTFs.

```html!
<form id="autosubmit" action="https://<target_form_URL>" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="xxx" value="yyy" hidden>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<script>
 document.getElementById("autosubmit").submit();
</script>
```

ðŸ“š During CTFs, it may take between one and five minutes.

## Anti-CSRF Token

Some websites have a CSRF token, mostly attached to HTML forms, as a form of protection against CSRF attacks and other automation tools.

It's a generated value that is added to the form, often as a hidden HTML `<input>` field. It proves that someone submitting a form effectively visited the page with the form beforehand.

Many tools have built-in switches to handle/by-pass such forms.
