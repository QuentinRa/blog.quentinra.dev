Fundamentally, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) refers to using the session of a user logged to a website to perform API calls without their consent. For instance, an API call to modify their password.

[XSS](/cybersecurity/red-team/s3.exploitation/vulns/web/xss.md) is a common attack technique to perform a CSRF attack.

Many modern browsers have built-in anti-CSRF measures, such as with the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
