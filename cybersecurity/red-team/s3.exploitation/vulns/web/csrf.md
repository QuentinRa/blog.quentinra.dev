Fundamentally, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) refers to using the session of a user logged to a website to perform API calls without their consent. For instance, an API call to modify their password.

[XSS](/cybersecurity/red-team/s3.exploitation/vulns/web/xss.md) is a common attack technique to perform a CSRF attack.

Many modern browsers have built-in anti-CSRF measures, such as with the `Content-Security-Policy` header.

## Anti-CSRF Token

Some websites have a CSRF token, mostly attached to HTML forms, as a form of protection against CSRF attacks and other automation tools.

It's a generated value that is added to the form, often as a hidden HTML `<input>` field. It proves that someone submitting a form effectively visited the page with the form beforehand.

Many tools have built-in switches to handle/by-pass such forms.
