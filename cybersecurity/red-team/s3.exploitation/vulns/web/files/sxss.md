<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

The malicious code is stored by the website, usually in a database. Then, on another page loading the data from the database, a vulnerable website will execute the malicious code.

For instance, a user using the value `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` as username. Then, on a vulnerable profile page, any user opening a link to the compromised profile, will execute the malicious code.
