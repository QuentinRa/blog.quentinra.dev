# Reflected XSS

[Go back](../xss.md)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The malicious code is usually inside a URL, and the vulnerable website when loading the URL, will execute the malicious website.
</div><div>

For instance, "`https://example.com/vulnerable_search_engine.php`" is a <small>(theoretical)</small> search engine in which the query is stored in the URL in the parameter `q`. The website is vulnerable to XSS, so if we open the URL, then some JavaScript will run in our browser.

```xml!
https://example.com/vulnerable_search_engine.php/?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27XSS%27)%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E
