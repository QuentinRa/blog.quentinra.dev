# Blind XSS

[Go back](../xss.md)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

In blind <small>(or out-band)</small> XSS, you are sending the payload somewhere, but you don't know if the destination is vulnerable.

For instance, using XSS in a contact or a support forms to steal information from the admin-side website (if any).

We are calling it "blind XSS", because it's not possible to see if it worked. You will usually write some JavaScript code to exfiltrate the results a server you own.
