Request Smuggling is a request that is interpreted as two by the back-end while the others only saw one request.

This often works by injecting something in the HTTP Headers.

One specific sub-attack is called [CRLF Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting). For instance, it may be used to corrupt logs by inserting malicious logs.

Another kind of attack exploiting [HTTP Headers](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/http.md#http-headers) is called Verb Tampering. If the webserver is misconfigured or the code contains logic flaws, another HTTP method might be accepted while we are denied access with the 'intended' HTTP methods.

* **Ex**: A website expecting a POST request but using `$_REQUEST` may be vulnerable to injection using GET ([Refer to Logic Flaws](/cybersecurity/red-team/s2.discovery/techniques/websites/logic_flaws.md#php-_request-logic-flaw))

* **Ex**: A website using `.htaccess` to request a password might be misconfigured and bypassed using `GETS` or `PUT` etc.
