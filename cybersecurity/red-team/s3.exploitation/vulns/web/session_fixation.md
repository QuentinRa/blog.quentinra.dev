Session fixation is possible when we are able to craft a request or a URL with an arbitrary session name <small>(often matching a valid session)</small>.

```text!
URL/?param=some_session_ID => PHPSESSID=some_session_ID
```

It would be exploited in social engineering attacks. An attacker would send a link with a session name they picked. When the victim logs in, the hacker can use the session to access the victim account.

To prevent this attack 🛡️, it's often encouraged to issue a new session when a user get more privileges <small>(guest=>logged=>admin)</small>.

📚 A large number of applications assign session IDs to every client.
