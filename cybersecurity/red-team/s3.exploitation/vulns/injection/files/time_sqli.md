# Time-based SQLi

A time-based SQLi is when we internationally delay the response from the database based on the condition.

For instance, "if the DMBS is MariaDB, wait 5 seconds". If the usual requests takes 1 seconds, and the request takes ~6 seconds, we know that the DMBS is MariaDB.

#### Manual Time-based SQLi

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A Time-based SQLi is a [Boolean-based](boolean_sqli.md) SQLi in which we added a `UNION SELECT` calling the function `sleep`:

```diff
-UNION SELECT NULL
+UNION SELECT SLEEP(5)
```

The select is ONLY called if there is at least one record selected, meaning the condition in the where is at least true for one record.

As the Boolean-based SQLi is based on failing or not the condition of the where, we don't have anything new to do.
