**Some websites may use the underlying system to run commands.** For instance, a website on Linux might use `grep`, `sed`, or other utilities to do things faster/easily.

A **command injection** occurs when a developer uses the user input in commands without proper sanitization/measures.

```php!
$search = $_GET['q'];
$res = system("grep \"$search\" content/");
echo "<pre>$res</pre>";
```

With the following payload: `" -V; cat /etc/passwd #`, the command executed will be as follows, allowing us to steal /etc/passwd

```bash!
grep "" -V; cat /etc/passwd # content/
```

**Command-injection** is a vulnerability leading to **Remote Command Execution** (RCE) <small>(which also means Remote Code Execution)</small>.

There are two kinds of command injections

* **Regular/in-band**: same channel to attack and gather results
* **Blind/out-band**: different channels to attack and gather results
    * Using redirections/flags, create a URL-accessible output file

```bash!
[...] cat /etc/passwd > /var/www/html/output.txt [...]
```

<ul>

* Using commands such as `sleep`/... to do a time-based attack

</ul>

```bash!
[...] true && sleep 5 [...]
```
