Most websites are using a [relational database](/programming-languages/databases/relational/_knowledge/index.md) to store data, and the [SQL](/programming-languages/databases/relational/sql/index.md) query language to query the database.

When making a SQL request, a programmer may use the user input. For instance, a product name for a query to search a product.

There is a SQL injection when a user inputs SQL code, and the request interpret the user input as SQL code.

‚û°Ô∏è A hacker may be able to fetch/create/update/delete records!

üî• While SQL injections are known since 1998, they are still a frequent vulnerability found in applications. They are found in every language.

A vulnerable [PHP](/programming-languages/web/php/_general/index.md) code use the user input directly in the SQL request:

```php!
$name = $_GET['name']; // filled by the user
$sql = "Select name from product where name LIKE '%$name%'";
```

* If the user enters the product name "`yummy`"


```sql!
Select name from product where name LIKE '%yummy%'";
```

* But, if they enter the product name "`' UNION SELECT "hacked"-- -`"

```sql!
Select name from product where name LIKE '%' UNION SELECT "hacked"-- -%'
```
