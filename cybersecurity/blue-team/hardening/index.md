Hardening refers to increasing the security <small>(confidentiality, integrity, availability)</small> by reducing the attack surface of:

* 🖥️ Workstations
* 🛰️ Servers
* 🌍 Network devices
* 📂 Apps, tools and services
* ...

Tasks to do are defined in guides provided by organization such as [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) or [ANSII](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2019/03/linux_configuration-en-v1.2.pdf), while organizations can have their own guide.
