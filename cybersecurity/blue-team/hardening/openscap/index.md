## Basic Usage

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Select A Guide

Each XML file is targeting a platform, such as `debian11`. Each XML is then divided in **profiles** which usually correspond to a guide adapted for a kind of target <small>(ex: CIS Guide for Workstations)</small>.

```shell!
$ oscap info some_compliance_guide.xml
[...]
Profiles:
    Title: Standard System Security Profile for Parrot Linux
    Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard
```
</div><div>

#### Compliance scan

To check if a system is hardened given a profile, and a guide:

```shell!
$ oscap xccdf eval \
    --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard \
    some_compliance_guide.xml
```

You can add more options right before the XML.

* To generate an HTML report, add `--report report.html`.
* To add verbosity, add `--verbose INFO`

üí° You can test a remote system using `oscap-ssh`, as long as the target has openscap installed. Refer to the manual.

üöÄ You can use a GUI called [scap-workbench](https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-workbench) (0.2k ‚≠ê).
