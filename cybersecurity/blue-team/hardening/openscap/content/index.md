[ComplianceAsCode/content](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content) <small>(1.9k ‚≠ê)</small> is a tool to create a product-specific XML <small>(ssg-debian11-ds.xml)</small> used by **OpenSCAP** üîé.

In a nutshell, a product is an operating system or an app on which we run a compliance test, such as "debian11". It has profiles, such as "workstation.profile", which lists what "rules" we will use.

A rule, such as "partition_for_tmp" <small>(it checks if there is a separate partition for /tmp)</small>, contains a way to test the compliance of a system to something, along with other stuff such as remediation notes/scripts...

Note that the project is *somewhat* complex. ‚ö†Ô∏è

There are multiple reasons to get involved with the Compliance As Code project. Most of the time, we may want to add support for a new product or for a new guide. Assuming that what you want to do, the [Compliance As Code Docker](https://github.com/ComplianceNinjas/compliance-as-code-docker) project might help.

To get started ‚ú®: 

```shell!
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ComplianceNinjas/compliance-as-code-docker.git
$ docker compose up -d
$ docker attach $(docker compose ps -q)
$ ./build_product debian11 -j $(nproc)
```
