[ComplianceAsCode/content](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content) <small>(1.8k ‚≠ê)</small> is a tool to create a platform-specific XML used by **OpenSCAP** üîé. It allows you to select which rules will be applied, and tune them to fit your target platform üöÄ.

* Note that the project is *somewhat* complex

In a nutshell, a product is an operating system or an app on which we run a compliance test, such as `debian11`. It has profiles, such as `workstation.profile`, which lists what "rules" we will use.

A rule, such as `partition_for_tmp` <small>(checks if there is a separate partition for /tmp)</small>, contains a way to test the compliance of a system, along other stuff such as remediation notes/scripts...

A test is written in [OVAL](https://ovalproject.github.io/getting-started/tutorial/), which is XML-based. Some tests are referred to as templates, if they were designed to be reused in multiple rules, but with different arguments passed to them.

In most files: `rule.yml`, `some_oval.xml`... You can use [jinja](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jinja_macros/01-general.html) <small>([official doc](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/))</small> macros to inject some code within a file <small>(ex: branching, loops, args...)</small>.

Here are some notes about [OVAL](content/oval.md), which is used in `templates`, `checks`, and `applicability` files. Here are some notes about [jinja](content/jinja.md) too.
