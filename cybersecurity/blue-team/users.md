Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Access control

* XACML
* DAC: each owner allow access
* MAC: allowed by a central entity
* RBAC
* RB-RBAC: if condition then permission (mails to folder)
* ABAC: based on the value of the request attributes, resources, env
* Where ACLs?: Database (no), Middleware/API (usually here), Client (dangerous is directly interacting with the API)
</div><div>

IAM

* Identify and Access management (IAM/GIA)
* Has a lifecycle
* Authorization creep: remove previous roles/lifecycle
* Privileged Identity Management (PIM): from organization role to system role
* Privileged Access Management (PAM): manage the role that a privileged user has.
