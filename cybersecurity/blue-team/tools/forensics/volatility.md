Volatility is a popular free memory forensics tool. There is a deprecated [python2](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility) version <small>(which is hard to install, 6.3k ‚≠ê)</small>, and there is a [python3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3) version <small>(1.6k ‚≠ê, in-development)</small>.

```ps
$ git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3
$ cd volatility3
$ python3 vol.py -h
```

To use Volatility, you need a memory capture. You can use [DumpIt.exe](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Dumpit), [WinPmem](https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem) (0.4k ‚≠ê), [Redline](https://fireeye.market/apps/211364), [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager)...

Use `-f` to load a memory dump. Assuming the memory dump is `mdump.sav` in the current folder:

```ps
$ python3 vol.py -f mdump.sav [...]
```

Profiles from volatility 2 are now expressed as [plugins](https://volatility3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/volatility3.plugins.html). You will use `xxx.info` instead of `imageinfo` to learn about the operating system run in a capture; with `xxx` one among `windows`, `linux`, `mac`.

## Windows notes

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Assuming that the host is running Windows, we can use:

* ‚û°Ô∏è Find information about the operating system

```ps
$ python3 vol.py [...] windows.info
```

* ‚û°Ô∏è List running processes

```ps
$ python3 vol.py [...] windows.pslist
```

üëâ Malicious processes tend to hide themselves.

* ‚û°Ô∏è Scan a specific process

```ps
$ python3 vol.py [...] windows.psscan
```
</div><div>

* ‚û°Ô∏è Show processes in which some code may have been injected

```ps
$ python3 vol.py [...] windows.malfind
```

* ‚û°Ô∏è Dump a specific process files (DLL/...)

```ps
$ python3 vol.py [...] windows.dumpfiles --pid xxx -o path/to/extract/dll
```

* ‚û°Ô∏è Show network activity

```ps
$ python3 vol.py [...] windows.netstat
```
