* [CVE-2023-32784](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32784): if we have memory dump when keepass was unlocked and running, we are able to dump almost all the cleartext password <small>(aside from first char)</small>. There are many PoC below:

[keepass-password-dumper](https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper) <small>(0.6k ‚≠ê)</small> in `.NET`. There is also [keepass-dump-masterkey](https://github.com/matro7sh/keepass-dump-masterkey) <small>(0.1k ‚≠ê)</small> or [keepass_dump](https://github.com/z-jxy/keepass_dump) <small>(0.01k ‚≠ê)</small> both in `Python`.
