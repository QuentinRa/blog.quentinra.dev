[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) is a web interface for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data in real-time. It's often used as a [SIEM](/cybersecurity/blue-team/topics/logs.md#security-information-and-event-management-siem).

It's a paid software. There is a 60-days free trial for companies.

**Ports** üê≤: 8000 <small>(TCP/HTTPS)</small>, 8089 <small>(TCP/Splunkd)</small>

The [splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/) website is the official website to browse for add-ons to extend Splunk usually for a specific usage.

#### Enumeration

* Navigate to `Help > About > Version` to find the version <small>(logged)</small>

#### Foothold

* There is no authentication in the free version. If a trial version that has expired is still installed, if becomes a free version.

* Default credentials are `admin:changeme` in older versions. For newer versions, the password is set at install.

#### Exploitation

There are multiple ways of running code. We can use scripted input such as with [reverse_shell_splunk](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk) <small>(0.04k ‚≠ê, 2018 ü™¶)</small>.

To target a Windows host, we need to configure the `run.ps1` script.

```shell!
$ git clone https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk
$ cd reverse_shell_splunk/
$ nano reverse_shell_splunk/bin/run.ps1
$ tar -cvzf updater.tar.gz reverse_shell_splunk
```

Navigate to Apps > Edit, and click on "install app from file."

‚û°Ô∏è See also: `use exploit/multi/http/splunk_upload_app_exec`.

‚û°Ô∏è For persistence, we may configure the schedule of the scripted input. If the server is a deployment server, and if target hosts have an `Universal Forwarders` we may be able to compromise them.
