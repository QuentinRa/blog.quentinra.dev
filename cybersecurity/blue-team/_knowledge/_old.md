R

* **Advanced Persistent Threat** (APT): usually, a hacker wants to remain as long as possible within an infected network. They are using backdoors, and keep updating the code to avoid being discovered.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response** (EDS)
* **Deceptive security**

Endpoint Protection

* antivirus
* anti-malware

* Security Operation Center (SOC): a team of cybersecurity professionals working 24/7 <small>(detect unusual activity, vulnerabilities, intrusions, violations, training/awareness)</small>. They are using the firewall/DNS/DHCP/... logs, Network security monitoring (NSM), and they might use a SIEM.

YYY

* Block an IP after $n$ failed attempts within $x$ seconds
* Use a strong password policy
* Delay authentication attempts (throttle) to slow down attacks
* Use a CAPTCHA while taking into account that they are services to "bypass" them
* Use two-Factor authentication

ZZZ

* "root", "bin", "adm", "operator", "admin", "administrator", "bureaucrat", "steward", "checkuser", "oversight", "sysop", "bot", etc.
* [username policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Username_policy#Inappropriate_usernames)

XXX

* Set up a robust password policy
    * Length, Complexity, Periodic updates, Lock, History...
    * Lock accounts for X minutes of inactivity
    * Add strong authentication (two-factor/MFA)
* Secure external devices
    * Disable booting using an external device
    * Detect and prevent them to install something/be installed
    * Use an antivirus to scan them
    * Forbid the use of local printers <small>(over secured network printers)</small>
    * Disable autorun <small>(execution of code)</small> when connecting devices
* User permissions
    * Setup access control <small>(no excessive privileges, no shared accounts...)</small>. Only administrator should be allowed to disable/configure security-related tools.
    * Ask for a password to edit BIOS configuration
    * Disallow to remotely start a device
    * Disable unneeded programs and services
    * Disable/Limit the use of local user accounts <small>(if not required)</small>
    * Do not give admin privilege to local accounts <small>(unless required)</small>
    * Ensure we can't use a workstation without a password
    * Limit access to the Windows registry

‚û°Ô∏è For root/administrator accounts, the password should be updated regularly, and its usage should be justified.

‚û°Ô∏è Tell users when they are not allowed to access something, or when it is monitored, and when it can lead to prosecution.
