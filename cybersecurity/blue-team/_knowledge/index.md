**The security triad (CIA)** is a famous principle used everywhere in security. The opposite is DAD <small>(Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction)</small>.

* 🔒 Confidentiality: only those allowed can access resources
* 🔎 Integrity: only allowed modification can modify resources
* 📂 Availability: resources are available when needed

There is also the French "DICAI" model that extends CIA with

* 🔑 Authentication and Identification: verify the identity of users
* ⌛ Irrevocability: once performed, cannot be undone

**Reduce the attack surface** 🏄‍♂️: avoid unused software, plugins, solutions/... that are potential attack vectors.

**Defense-in-depth** 🕸️: use of multiple layers of security, along with various tactics, to slow down/stop an intruder

**Triple-A principles** 🔒: Authentication <small>(verify the identity)</small>, Authorization <small>(determine the permissions)</small>, and Accounting <small>(logs)</small>.

**Zero trust** 🔎: a concept. No blind trust, verify everything, assume everyone is a threat, and continuously monitor resources.

**Principle of the least privilege** 👮: everyone, regardless of their role in the company <small>(CEO...)</small>, should have the least privilege that they require to do their job.

**Sweet spot** 🍭: find the right balance between security and productivity. Don't burden users too much.
