# Logging and monitoring

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Logging has two main purpose which are to monitor events

* üîé to detect suspicious activities
* ‚öñÔ∏è to comply with investigations or legal regulations

We first need to identify what is generating logs

* Workstations <small>(Windows 10/11...)</small> and Servers
* Applications and databases
* Routers, Switches, Firewalls, Antivirus, IDS...
* ...

Then, we need to determine what's useful to log

* **User actions** üßî: successful and failed login attempts, creation or suppression of users, change of permissions, privilege escalation <small>(su/sudo/runas)</small>
* **System actions** üíª: application/services started/stopped, startup and shutdown, change to system settings...
* **Application events** üñ®Ô∏è: user actions, warnings, errors...
* **Network events** üì∂: incoming/outgoing traffic...
</div><div>

As we will have many logs, we need to prioritize them

* **Priority 1**: critical events that require immediate intervention <small>(ex: system/IDS/antivirus crash, access to admin accounts...)</small>
* **Priority 2**: important events that require attention <small>(ex: failed login attempts, system/application warnings/errors...)</small>
* **Priority 3**: informal events <small>(ex: successful login attempts...)</small>

Then, the last step is to notify or alert that an event occurred, based on it's level of prioritization.

* **Notification** üì®: SMS, email, push notification... according to the priority; to the relevant parties
* The incident response team will handle the **Triage**, **Response**, and **Resolution**.

The minimal information needed to provide useful details are

* Date and time of the event 
* Source and destination IP addresses or hostnames 
* Event type or category <small>(e.g. login, file access, network traffic)</small>
* User ID <small>(if applicable)</small>
* Outcome of the event <small>(success or failure)</small>
