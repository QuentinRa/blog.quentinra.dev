## üëª To-do üëª

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

Access control

* Discretionary Access Control (DAC): the owner of a resource define access rights for others. Ex: Unix File System.
* Mandatory Access Control (MAC): access based on labels assigned to subjects (ex: users) and objects (ex: files), allowed by a central entity
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): each role is given permissions, and users are given roles based on what they do in the organization.
* Rule-Based Access Control (RBAC): rules that determine what someone can do based on who they are <small>(ex: IP...)</small>
  * RB-RBAC and not RBAC?
  * if condition then permission (mails to folder)
* Time-Based Access Control (TAC): access is granted during an interval of time <small>(ex: working hours)</small>
* ABAC: based on the value of the request attributes, resources, env
* XACML

‚û°Ô∏è Tell users when they are not allowed to access something, or when it is monitored, and when it can lead to prosecution.

TLDR

* 2FA for admins
* Disable default accounts/change default usernames
* Integration with AD can make it easier
