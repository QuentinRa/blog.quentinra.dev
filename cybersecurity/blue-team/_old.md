# Data governance

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

At the top, the semantic is the most important as it will impact the quality of the element below. Problems at the top will impact a lot the business. The more we go down, the more we have data.

* **Metadata**: describe what kind of data we have
* **Reference data**: data used as a reference for other data, such as a list of countries, ranks for customers <small>(iron, gold, diamond)</small>...
* **Structural data**: External entities <small>(ex: providers, clients...)</small> and the data related to the service/product <small>(ex: delivering address...)</small>
* **Organizational data**: data about the company <small>(ex: employees, sales inventory, departments, hierarchies...)</small>
* **Operational data**: data generated by the activity of the company <small>(ex: orders, invoices...)</small>
* **Audit data**: logs of every change of the data

➡️ We call "Master data" the structural, organizational, and operational data altogether. This is the core and critical data of the company which is considered the single source of truth.

## Data management

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Principles/Policies/Guidelines/Standards

The PPGS are defining the rules and standards for data management.

* Principles: high-level guidance <small>(why do we need this data?)</small>
* Policies: more specific rules <small>(what do we need?)</small>
* Guidelines: recommendations and best practices <small>(how?)</small>
* Standards: technical specifications <small>(quality...)</small>

#### Gartner's GAIP

Gartner released a research report provides guidelines for improving data management called "Generally Accepted Information Principles for Improved Information Asset Management".

#### The five "As" in data management

The 5 "As" is a framework to describe the five key aspects of effective data management:

1. Availability
2. Accuracy
3. Accessibility
4. Appropriateness
5. Auditability

#### Levels of data management

To start with data governance, you could follow these steps

* Redact a plan to fix the problem
* Display the positive impact of fixing the problem

Finally, you can formalize the data governance. There are five levels of data management:

1. Ad hoc: individuals manage data in their own way
2. Repeatable: departments establish basic policies/procedures
3. Defined: the organization start formalizing data management
4. Managed: data is actively monitored and inventoried
5. Optimized: data management is implicit in all business processes, and continuously improved

The goal is to move from the lower levels to the higher levels, where data is managed effectively and driving business value.

#### CIA for data security

If we apply the security triad (CIA):

* Confidentiality: only those allowed can access data
* Integrity: data was not tampered with
* Availability: data is available when needed <small>(backups...)</small>

For security practices to be useful, everyone, regardless of their task, must be aware of what it takes to protect data. Everyone should know who to contact if they detect a problem.

#### The five "As" in security

The 5 "As" is a framework to describe key aspects of security:

1. Authentication: verify a user/device before granting access
2. Authorization: determine what the user can do
3. Access: allow the user to retrieve/edit information
4. Admissibility: everything that the user has access to
5. Audit: monitor access to ensure their appropriate use

#### Data Access control

➡️ Using inference, someone can use non-confidential data such as birthdate, postal code, and gender to find someone.
