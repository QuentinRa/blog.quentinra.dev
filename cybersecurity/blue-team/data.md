There are risks when dealing with data

* **Non-compliance with legal requirements** (GDPR, PCII...): the company must ensure that they are able to comply with legal requirement to avoid fines/...
* **Reputation loss**: data breaches usually cause distrust
* **Invasion of privacy**: data not correctly handled that leak
* **Industrial espionage**: someone else gain access to our data
