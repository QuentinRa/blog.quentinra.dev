# Data governance

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Data governance starts by considering data as a critical asset of the company. It's a new way of thinking/doing. We define 

* processes
* policies
* roles 
* responsibilities
* practices

to ensure data is efficiently exploited, managed, and protected.

#### The DIKW model

The DIKW model <small>(Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom)</small> is a pyramid-shaped model that represent how "data" is transformed to "wisdom". The goal is to show understand how raw data can be transformed in useful information.

Raw data <small>(ex: 1984)</small> is transformed to information by adding a context <small>(ex: Los Angeles summer olympics)</small>. By interpreting the information, it becomes knowledge <small>(ex: it occurs every 4 years)</small>. And trough reflexion, it become wisdom <small>(ex: the next one will be in 2024)</small>.

## Security risks and business needs

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There are risks when dealing with data

* **Non-compliance with legal requirements** (GDPR, PCII...): the company must ensure that they are able to comply with legal requirement to avoid fines/...
* **Reputation loss**: data breaches usually cause distrust
* **Invasion of privacy**: data not correctly handled that leak
* **Industrial espionage**: someone else gain access to our data
* **Lack of quality**: decrease of efficiency because of duplicates, incorrect or incomplete data, along with a cost to fix it

But data is needed by the company, so we can't "lock it". This is one of the challenges of data governance.

3. **Data Security**: processes set to prevent unauthorized access, data misuse...
4. **Data integration & Interoperability**: how is the data shared/passed between each service?

5. **Documents & Content Management**: how and where are physical documents stored?
6. **Reference & Master Data**: classification of data in groups according to some criteria <small>(ex: sensitive data...)</small>
