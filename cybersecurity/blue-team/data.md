# Data governance

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Data governance is usually involved in the early stages of security architecture, focusing on the data.

Data governance starts by considering data as a critical asset of the company. It's a new way of thinking/doing.

* 🥡 Define how data is accessed/shared
* 🗃️ Define how data is stored
* 💰 Define how data is used/processed
* 🐸 Define how data is managed <small>(quality, retained, deleted...)</small>
* 🔑 Define how data is protected
* ...
</div><div>

We need to identify the **needs**, **requirements**, and the **risks** related to the data, as defined in [Risk management](/cybersecurity/blue-team/risk.md), to reduce risks under an acceptable level. Some risks related to data are:

* 💰 Fines due to non-compliance with legal requirements <small>(GDPR...)</small>
* 🔥 Reputation loss <small>(data breaches usually cause distrust)</small>
* 💥 Invasion of privacy <small>(leak of data that harm clients)</small>
* 🔫 Industrial espionage <small>(a company access our private/confidential data)</small>
* 🍃 Lack of quality <small>(duplicates, loss of time/efficiency, errors...)</small>
* ...

Data is needed by the company, so we can't "lock it" 🔐. This is a challenge of data governance: **Protect to enable** <small>(Malcolm W. Harkins)</small>.
