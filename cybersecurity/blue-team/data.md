# Data governance

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Data governance starts by considering data as a critical asset of the company. It's a new way of thinking/doing. We define 

* processes
* policies
* roles 
* responsibilities
* practices

to ensure data is efficiently exploited, managed, and protected.

#### The DIKW model

The DIKW model <small>(Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom)</small> is a pyramid-shaped model that represent how "data" is transformed to "wisdom". The goal is to show understand how raw data can be transformed in useful information.

Raw data <small>(ex: 1984)</small> is transformed to information by adding a context <small>(ex: Los Angeles summer olympics)</small>. By interpreting the information, it becomes knowledge <small>(ex: it occurs every 4 years)</small>. And trough reflexion, it become wisdom <small>(ex: the next one will be in 2024)</small>.

## Security risks and business needs

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There are risks when dealing with data

* **Non-compliance with legal requirements** (GDPR, PCII...): the company must ensure that they are able to comply with legal requirement to avoid fines/...
* **Reputation loss**: data breaches usually cause distrust
* **Invasion of privacy**: data not correctly handled that leak
* **Industrial espionage**: someone else gain access to our data
* **Lack of quality**: decrease of efficiency because of duplicates, incorrect or incomplete data, along with a cost to fix it
</div><div>

But data is needed by the company, so we can't "lock it". This is one of the challenges of data governance.

## Data Management Association (DAMA) framework

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The Data Management Association (DAMA) framework is an approach to data governance.

➡️ See DAMA wheel on Google/... Here is a text summary:

1. **Data Modeling and design**: what is the data and why do we need it? What are the regulations/...?
2. **Data Storage & Operations**: where will we store the data?
3. **Data Security**: processes set to prevent unauthorized access, data misuse...
4. **Data integration & Interoperability**: how is the data shared/passed between each service?
</div><div>

5. **Documents & Content Management**: how and where are physical documents stored?
6. **Reference & Master Data**: classification of data in groups according to some criteria <small>(ex: sensitive data...)</small>
7. **Data Warehousing & Business Intelligence**: software/systems to help the higher-ups understand what kind of clients they have/... to manage the company.
8. **Metadata**: describe what kind of data we have
9. **Data Quality**: techniques used to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
10. **Data Architecture**: the overall design and structure of the data and information systems within an organization

## Data classification and valuation

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Classification

At the top, the semantic is the most important as it will impact the quality of the element below. Problems at the top will impact a lot the business. The more we go down, the more we have data.

* **Metadata**: describe what kind of data we have
* **Reference data**: data used to sort or provide additional information to the data below <small>(ex: categories to sort products, a purchase history for each client...)</small>
* **Structural data**: External entities <small>(ex: providers, clients...)</small> and the data related to the service/product <small>(ex: delivering address...)</small>
* **Organizational data**: data about the company <small>(ex: employees, sales inventory...)</small>
* **Operational data**: data generated by the activity of the company <small>(ex: orders, invoices...)</small>
* **Audit data**: logs of every change of the data
</div><div>

➡️ We call "Master data" the structural, organizational, and operational data altogether. This is the core and critical data of the company which is considered the single source of truth.

#### Valuation

It's important to associate a value to data in order to find which data require more resources <small>(ex: more advanced measures for VIP...)</small>...

* How much did it cost to acquire this data?
* How much will it cost if we damaged/lost this data?
* What's the impact if this data isn't available?
* The value it adds to business operations/decision-making.
* The revenue generated using this data.
* The cost to protect this data.
* How much would the competitors pay for this data?
* ...
