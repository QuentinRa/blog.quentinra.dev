# Webservers vulnerabilities

This page is more about issues that can be fixed on the server level. They may also be fixed on the website level, but if by any means, a hacker manages to interact with the server directly, even if it's a 404, then insecure headers such as headers disclosing the server version may be sent.

## üé£ Toolsüé£

Hackers will usually use these tools to check your headers/... in addition to the tools to [grab HTTP headers](/cybersecurity/exploitation/services/banner.md#grabbing-http-headers).

[As defined by the HTTP protocol](/it/networking/protocols/index.md#-http---80-tcp), HTTP requests encapsulate headers, with can be used by both the client and the server to exchange information. Vulnerabilities related to headers could lead to

* Version Exposure
* Injections
    * XSS (see [XSS](/cybersecurity/exploitation/web/forms/xss.md))
    * SSRF (see [SSRF](/cybersecurity/exploitation/web/forms/ssrf.md))
    * Command-injection (see [RCE](/cybersecurity/exploitation/web/forms/command_injection.md))
    * File inclusion (see [File/Path exploits](/cybersecurity/exploitation/web/forms/file_path_exploits.md#file-inclusion))
* CSRF
