**Disclaimer** ‚ö†Ô∏è: I had a hard time putting content in a place I would expect them to be, hence this page will **only** cover techniques to get information about a service using the banner, while **techniques** like enumerating users/..., **knowledge**, along other in-depth stuff will be in [Exploiting Services](/cybersecurity/exploitation/services/index.md).

## Banner grabbing of noisy services

[![netsecchallenge](../../_badges/thmp-p/netsecchallenge.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/netsecchallenge)

This is automatically done by tools like `nmap`, along with a few more checks! But, it's interesting to know how these tools work.

### üîì Telnet - 23 (tcp)

`telnet` is useful to grab the banner of noisy TCP services.

```bash
$ telnet IP 21
# you may see some FTP banner
[...] FTP server (Version 6.4/OpenBSD/Linux-ftpd-0.17) ready.
```
</div><div>

### üîì netcat - (tcp/udp)

`nc` (netcat) doing the same as `telnet`, but we can also grab banners of noisy UDP services.

```bash
$ nc IP 21
# you may see some FTP banner
[...] FTP server (Version 6.4/OpenBSD/Linux-ftpd-0.17) ready.
```

## Grabbing HTTP headers

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

You should use `curl`

```bash
$ curl -I IP:port
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
# ...
```

You can use [nmap](/cybersecurity/discovery/nmap/index.md)

```bash
$ nmap --script=http-server-header.nse IP -p80,443
$ nmap -sC IP -p80,443 # may provide less information
```

You can use your browser, open the network tab of the dev console.

You can use [metasploit](/cybersecurity/exploitation/general/metasploit/msfconsole.md)

```bash
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version
```
</div><div>

You could use `telnet` too, but I doubt you would want to write requests manually... And, it will only work for HTTP, not HTTPS.

```bash
$ telnet IP 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
HOST: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
# ...
```

> **HOST header**: as a quick remainder, a server = an IP can be associated with multiple domains. The HOST header contains the domain that you want to query, that is hosted by the server you contacted.
