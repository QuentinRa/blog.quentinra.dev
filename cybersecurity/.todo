OWASP criteria to rank a vulnerability (804)

-------
"Rootkits: A type of malicious software that allows an attacker to gain administrative access to a
computer or network without being detected. Rootkits can hide their presence from antivirus software
and other security tools, allowing an attacker to maintain access to a compromised system for extended periods."

BIA stands for Business Impact Analysis
-------

Bluetooth
=> eavesdropping
=> unauthorized access
=> malware and viruses to be transmitted
=> known vulnerabilities:
===> BlueBorne (attackers take control of devices without user interaction)
===> Bluejacking to send unsolicited messages or spam to the device
===> Bluesnarfing to access data stored on the device
===> Bluetooth device spoofing attack
)) avoid pairing with unknown/untrusted devices
)) turn off bluetooth
)) up-to-date
++ bluetooth scanning tool to identify vulnerable devices do not require pairing

Wi-Fi
=> eavesdropping (intercept wireless network traffic and analyzing it for sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords)
=> deauthentication (send deauthentication packets to wireless clients, causing them to disconnect from the wireless network)
=> jamming (flood the wireless network with interference, causing it to become unusable)
