# Reverse Engineering

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a program, or system to understand its structure, function, and behavior.

It often means getting back the original code/system using disassembling, decompiling, or similar methods.

It can be used to understand how a malware works 🛡️ or to find vulnerabilities in a program/system in a black-box assessment 💥.

## Code Obfuscation

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Code obfuscation is an automated process to make the code less-readable for humans. A simple example would be by replacing variables names with less readable names such as `_0x565`.

Code obfuscation doesn't impact the program functionality, but it may impact its performance: obfuscated code is usually slower.

➡️ Ex: [Beautify Tools Obfuscator](http://beautifytools.com/javascript-obfuscator.php) for JavaScript.
