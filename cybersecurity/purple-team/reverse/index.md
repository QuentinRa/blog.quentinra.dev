# Reverse Engineering

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a program, or system to understand its structure, function, and behavior.

It often means getting back the original code/system using disassembling, decompiling, or similar methods.

It can be used to understand how a malware works üõ°Ô∏è or to find vulnerabilities in a program/system in a black-box assessment üí•.

## Code Obfuscation

[![javascriptdeobfuscation](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/javascriptdeobfuscation.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/javascript-deobfuscation)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Code obfuscation is an automated process to make the code less-readable for humans. A simple example would be by replacing variables names with less readable names such as `_0x565`.

Code obfuscation doesn't impact the program functionality, but it may impact its performance: obfuscated code is usually slower.

A few obfuscators for JavaScript:

* [beautifytools](http://beautifytools.com/javascript-obfuscator.php)
* [obfuscator.io](https://obfuscator.io/)
* [jjencode](https://utf-8.jp/public/jjencode.html)
* [aaencode](https://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html)

You may try [unpacker](https://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html) to un-obfuscate Javascript code.

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.
