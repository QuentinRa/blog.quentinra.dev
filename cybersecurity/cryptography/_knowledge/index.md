# Cryptography

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Cryptography has three main objectives:

* 🔐 protect confidentiality <small>(encryption)</small>
* 🧬 ensure integrity <small>(checksum)</small>
* ✅ ensure authenticity <small>(certificate, signatures)</small>

There are two kind of cryptographic algorithms

* [Symmetric algorithms](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/symmetric/index.md): one shared private key
* [Asymmetric algorithms](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/symmetric/index.md): one public key, one private key
</div><div>

Cryptanalysis are those with the duty to analyse and find weakness in the underlying maths of cryptographic algorithms.

➡️ Python is quite used in cryptography, because reasons like there are many libraries with cryptographic algorithms, integers are not limited in size, it's popular in mathematical fields...

## Terminology

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

In a nutshell, we use these terms:

* The input is a **plaintext** message 💬.

* It is **encrypted** 🔒 <small>(a.k.a. encipher)</small> using a cryptographic algorithm and a **key** 🔑. The output is called a **cyphertext** (`message encrypté`) 🔐. 

* It is **decrypted** 🔓  using a cryptographic algorithm and a **key** 🗝️.
</div><div>

Algorithms can be

* **Weak** 🔥: vulnerableto known attacks/easily broken
* **Acceptable** 🤔: meet the minimum security requirements
* **Secure** 🎩: secure against known attacks, resistant to cryptanalysis
* **Strong** 👑: both secure and efficient
