**Brute force attack** 🧨: trying all possible values until the correct one is found.

**Frequency analysis** 🪶: some letters/combinations of letters occur more frequently in a language. For instance, `e` is the most frequent letter in English/French.

**Cribbing attack**🧞‍♂️: guess parts of the plaintext/ciphertext and try to deduce the key.

**Entropy attacks** 🦄: find a weakness in the random number generation process used to generate cryptographic keys.

**Side-channel attacks** 🦐: exploit the implementation of the algorithm rather than the algorithm itself.

**Timing attacks** 🕰️: analyze the time it takes to perform different operations to find a potential exploit/information
