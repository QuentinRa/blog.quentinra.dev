# hashcat

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat) (15.9k ‚≠ê) is a well-known, and popular tool to crack passwords. For convenience‚Äôs sake, we store the hash in a file `hash`.

```ps
# use quotes, so that $/... aren't interpreted
$ echo 'some hash here' > myhash
```

Crack the password

```ps
$ hashcat -m code myhash wordlist
$ hashcat -m code myhash wordlist -o hashes_cracked
# in my case, hashcat started then stopped, 
# I had to use this awful option
$ hashcat -m code myhash wordlist --force
```

Once the password was cracked, you can see it

```ps
$ hashcat -m code myhash wordlist --show
```

**Token length exception**: I had this error so many times that I got crazy about it. There are many causes for this error, unfortunately.

* üßê Try to look for your hash format [on hashcat website](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes). There is an example of the output that hashcat is expecting. For instance, sometimes, you need a file with `hash:salt`.

* ü™≤ I don't know why, but it worked for me when I didn't use a file: `hashcat -m 160 hash:key wordlist`.

Hashcat stores cracked hashes in `~/.hashcat/hashcat.potfile`.

ATTENTION! Pure (unoptimized) backend kernels selected.
Pure kernels can crack longer passwords, but drastically reduce performance.
If you want to switch to optimized kernels, append -O to your commandline.

You can use rules

```ps
$ hashcat -m 0 myhash wordlist -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
