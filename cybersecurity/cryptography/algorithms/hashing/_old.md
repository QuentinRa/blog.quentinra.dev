# Crack (insecure) passwords

‚ö†Ô∏è Hash brute-forcing tools are (usually) using your CPU to compute results faster. On a VM, they may be less efficient, as the VM itself is taking a lot of resources.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat) (15.9k ‚≠ê) is with john the ripper, a well-known, and popular tool to crack passwords. For convenience‚Äôs sake, we store the hash in a file `hash`.

```bash
# use quotes, so that $/... aren't interpreted
$ echo 'some_hash' > hash
```

Crack the password

```bash
$ hashcat -m code hash wordlist
$ hashcat -m code hash wordlist -o hashes_cracked
# in my case, hashcat started then stopped, 
# I had to use this awful option
$ hashcat -m code hash wordlist --force
```

Once the password was cracked, you can see it

```bash
$ hashcat -m code hash wordlist --show
```

You can use rules <small>(see John section for explanations)</small>

```bash
$ hashcat -m 0 hash wordlist -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

**Token length exception**: I had this error so many times that I got crazy about it. There are many causes for this error, unfortunately.

* Try to look for your hash format [on hashcat website](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes). There is an example of the output that hashcat is expecting. For instance, sometimes, you need a file with `hash:salt`.

* I don't know why, but it worked for me when I didn't use a file: `hashcat -m 160 hash:key wordlist`.

Hashcat stores cracked hashes in `~/.hashcat/hashcat.potfile`.

<details class="details-e mt-4">
<summary>Single Crack mode</summary>

This is one of the three modes of John. It won't use a wordlist, but a username instead, as the user may have used their username with some slight modifications as their password. For the username "toto", john will use both

* **Word Mangling**: Toto tOTo toto1 toto!
* **GECOS**: other (GECOS) fields that are provided

You will have to change the format of your file

```text
username:password
```

While you may add some other fields that john will use, separated with `:`, such as in the Linux passwd file.

```bash
$ john hash --single --format=raw-md5
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Custom rules</summary>

You may try to exploit "password complexity predictability", for instance, the first character is usually an uppercase, and the last character a number. If a symbol was required, then it's most likely the last character, after the number.

You may edit `/etc/john/john.conf`, and add your rules. You may make a copy, and use this configuration instead of the default one. You can use the regex operation `[]` inside quotes. `c` means that the character is capitalized. `Az` means appending character, while `A0` means prepending.

```text
[List.Rules:RuleName]
cAz"[0-9] [!$%@]"
```

```bash
# use a custom rule
$ john --rule=RuleName
# use another config file
$ john --config=FILE
```

Pure kernels can crack longer passwords, but drastically reduce performance.
If you want to switch to optimized kernels, append -O to your commandline.
