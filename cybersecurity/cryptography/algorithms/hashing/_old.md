# Crack (insecure) passwords

‚ö†Ô∏è Hash brute-forcing tools are (usually) using your CPU to compute results faster. On a VM, they may be less efficient, as the VM itself is taking a lot of resources.

## hashcat

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat) (15.9k ‚≠ê) is with john the ripper, a well-known, and popular tool to crack passwords. For convenience‚Äôs sake, we store the hash in a file `hash`.

```bash
# use quotes, so that $/... aren't interpreted
$ echo 'some_hash' > hash
```

Crack the password

```bash
$ hashcat -m code hash wordlist
$ hashcat -m code hash wordlist -o hashes_cracked
# in my case, hashcat started then stopped, 
# I had to use this awful option
$ hashcat -m code hash wordlist --force
```

Once the password was cracked, you can see it

```bash
$ hashcat -m code hash wordlist --show
```

You can use rules <small>(see John section for explanations)</small>

```bash
$ hashcat -m 0 hash wordlist -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

**Token length exception**: I had this error so many times that I got crazy about it. There are many causes for this error, unfortunately.

* Try to look for your hash format [on hashcat website](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes). There is an example of the output that hashcat is expecting. For instance, sometimes, you need a file with `hash:salt`.

* I don't know why, but it worked for me when I didn't use a file: `hashcat -m 160 hash:key wordlist`.

## John the Ripper

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) (<small>Jumbo</small>, 6.9 ‚≠ê), a.k.a. **john**, is like hashcat, a tool to crack hashes. For convenience‚Äôs sake, we store the hash in a file `hash`.

```bash
# use quotes, so that $/... aren't interpreted
$ echo 'some_hash' > hash
```

You can use the default wordlist, and let john guess the format. Unfortunately, it doesn't work often, so provide at least the format.

```bash
# basic form with no format, and the default wordlist
$ john hash
$ john 'some_hash' # if you didn't use a file
```

List formats <small>(you don't need it with nth/haiti, as they give you the format)</small>. Note that standard formats, such as MD5, are starting with "raw-".

```bash
$ john --list=formats | grep -i "md5"
```

</div><div>

Provide the format

```bash
$ john hash --format=raw-md5
$ john hash --format=raw-md4
$ john hash --format=raw-sha1
```

You can provide a wordlist

```bash
$ john hash --format=raw-md4 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

<details class="details-e mt-4">
<summary>Single Crack mode</summary>

This is one of the three modes of John. It won't use a wordlist, but a username instead, as the user may have used their username with some slight modifications as their password. For the username "toto", john will use both

* **Word Mangling**: Toto tOTo toto1 toto!
* **GECOS**: other (GECOS) fields that are provided

You will have to change the format of your file

```text
username:password
```

While you may add some other fields that john will use, separated with `:`, such as in the Linux passwd file.

```bash
$ john hash --single --format=raw-md5
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Custom rules</summary>

You may try to exploit "password complexity predictability", for instance, the first character is usually an uppercase, and the last character a number. If a symbol was required, then it's most likely the last character, after the number.

You may edit `/etc/john/john.conf`, and add your rules. You may make a copy, and use this configuration instead of the default one. You can use the regex operation `[]` inside quotes. `c` means that the character is capitalized. `Az` means appending character, while `A0` means prepending.

```text
[List.Rules:RuleName]
cAz"[0-9] [!$%@]"
```

```bash
# use a custom rule
$ john --rule=RuleName
# use another config file
$ john --config=FILE
```

## Linux shadow hash cracking

[![linprivesc](../../../_badges/thm-p/linprivesc.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/linprivesc#task-12)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Modern Linux are using `sha512crypt`. Use name-that-hash, or any other tools to find the format if needed. The easy way is only passing the hash of the user you want

```bash
$ john hash --format=sha512crypt --wordlist=wordlist
```
</div><div>

But, there is a more complicated way. I think it's useful if using john "single" mode.

```bash
$ unshadow /path/to/stolen_passwd /path/to/stolen_shadow > hash
$ john hash --format=sha512crypt --wordlist=wordlist
```

Note that "unshadow" simply replaced the "x" in "passwd", with the password in "shadow", as you would find in some old Linux distros.
</div></div>

<hr class="sep-both">

## Windows password cracking

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Modern Windows are using the hash format "NT", also referred to as "NTLM", because "LM" was the previous hash format.

```bash
$ john hash --format=nt --wordlist=wordlist
```
</div><div>
</div></div>

## GPG passphrase cracking

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The `gpg` tool can be used to encrypt files, using a passphrase, which is like a password. It can also be used to sign something. For instance, GitHub allows you to sign your commits using GPG keys.

To encrypt something, you could do this. It will generate a `file.gpg`

```bash
$ gpg --cipher-algo AES-256 --symmetric file
```

And, to decrypt <small>(no passphrase is asked if it is cached)</small>

```bash
$ gpg -d file.gpg
# generate back your file
```
</div><div>

You can **crack a gpg passphrase** using john too! But, you need to convert the gpg passphrase to a hash first.

```bash
$ sudo gpg2john file.pgp > hash
```

Then, use john as usual, with the format "gpg"

```bash
$ john --format=gpg hash --wordlist=wordlist 
```

> If by any means you got someone's private key that was used to encrypt this file <small>(a key may be used instead of a passphrase)</small>, then use `gpg --import xxx.key` to import it, and decrypt the file as usual.
</div></div>

## SSH private key - passphrase cracking

[![basicpentestingjt](../../../_badges/thm-p/basicpentestingjt.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Some users are using a key instead of a password while connecting to a server via SSH, because, as long as the key does not leak, it's more secure than sending credentials.

```bash
ssh login@ip -i key
```
</div><div>

The key is usually protected by a passphrase. You can use `ssh2john` to convert it to a file that `john` can try to break.

```bash
$ ssh2john key > hash
$ john --format=ssh hash --wordlist=wordlist
```
</div></div>

## RAR password cracking

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

First convert the password to a file compatible with john.

```bash
$ rar2john hello.rar > hash
$ john hash --wordlist=wordlist
```
</div><div>

If you found the password, you can unrar your RAR with

```bash
$ unrar x hello.rar
# enter the password
```
</div></div>

## ZIP password cracking

[![agentsudoctf](../../../_badges/thm-p/agentsudoctf.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/agentsudoctf)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

First convert the password to a file compatible with john.

```bash
$ zip2john hello.zip > hash
$ john hash --wordlist=wordlist
```
</div><div>

If you found the password, you can unzip your ZIP with

```bash
$ unzip hello.zip
# enter the password
```
