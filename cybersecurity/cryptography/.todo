* exchanging keys
  * use public-private key to send the key
  * then use symmetric
  * In reality, you need to check authenticity

* Signature
* Certificates
  * Root CA trusted by device -> chain of trust
  * Let’s Encrypt

SSH that use keys instead of login/pass. ssh-keygen, ssh-copy-id, or manually copying the key into authorized_keys with cat.

DHK

An excellent video if you want a visual explanation is available here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI

DH Key Exchange is often used alongside RSA public key cryptography, to prove the identity of the person you’re talking to with digital signing. This prevents someone from attacking the connection with a man-in-the-middle attack by pretending to be Bob.

PGP?
PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It’s a software that implements encryption for encrypting files, performing digital signing and more.

GnuPG or GPG is an Open Source implementation of PGP from the GNU project.
