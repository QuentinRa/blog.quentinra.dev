The `gpg` tool can be used to encrypt files, using a passphrase, which is like a password. It can also be used to sign something. For instance, GitHub allows you to sign your commits using GPG keys.

To encrypt something, you could do this. It will generate a `file.gpg`

```shell!
$ gpg --cipher-algo AES-256 --symmetric file
```

And, to decrypt <small>(no passphrase is asked if it is cached)</small>

```ps
$ gpg -d file.gpg
# generate back your file
```
</div><div>

A **private key** can be used instead of a passphrase. To decrypt a file that was encrypted using a private key:

```ps
$ gpg --import xxx.key [...]
```

üîê To crack a gpg encrypted file, refer to [password brute force](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/index.md#gpg-passphrase-cracking).
