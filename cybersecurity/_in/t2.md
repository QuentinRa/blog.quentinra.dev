Access control

* Discretionary Access Control (DAC): the owner of a resource define access rights for others. Ex: Unix File System.
* Mandatory Access Control (MAC): access based on labels assigned to subjects (ex: users) and objects (ex: files).
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): each role is given permissions, and users are given roles based on what they do in the organization.
* Rule-Based Access Control (RBAC): rules that determine what someone can do based on who they are <small>(ex: IP...)</small>
* Time-Based Access Control (TAC): access is granted during an interval of time <small>(ex: working hours)</small>

MFA

* [yubico](https://www.yubico.com/)
* Google Passkeys / Windows Hello / iCloud Passkeys
* Something you know, have, are

**https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharkthebasics**

* Can merge PCAP files
* Statistics > Capture file properties
* wireshark do packet (protocol) dissection (split in IP/...)
* Edit > Find Packet
  * Type
  * Where
* CTRL+G (go to)
* CTRL+M (mark packet), Right-click "Packet comment"...
* View> Time display format (to change from using seconds since start of the capture)
* Analyze > Expert informations (problems/...)
* If you find a section JPEG in a packet, you can export in by right-clicking on it, then export packet bytes (or any file!)
* Right-click on something > apply as filter
* Right-click > Conversation filter (the conversation). You can colorize a conversation (alternatively).
* Right-click on a field => apply as column
* Follow > TCP stream
