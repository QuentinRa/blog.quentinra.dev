### Knowledge

### Configuration

You can configure SNMP on a Windows Server with ADDS. You can also configure the server using commands too such as

* `show snmp`: display the current configuration
* `snmp-server community [...]`: configure a community
* `no snmp-server community [...]`: delete a community
* `snmp-server location [...]`: set the location <small>(for humans)</small>
* `snmp-server host [...]`: define the hosts <small>(for traps...)</small>

### SNMPv2c

SNMPv2c is still used by some companies even if it's advised to use SNMPv3 as the latter is more secure. SNMPv2c

* ‚ùå is not scalable. Companies will experience performance problems that may lead to longer delays, and decrease the employees' efficiency.
* ‚ùå is not reliable: error messages can be misinterpreted as they may be incomplete or incorrect.
* ‚ùå is vulnerable: spoofing, tampering, sniffing...
* ‚úÖ Community strings can be set up. They are password-like string, that need to be complex and changed regularly. Only those with the correct community string can fetch data from a network device. By default, anyone can fetch data it. A community can be read-only (RO) or Read-Write (RW).

Commands: `snmpget`, `snmpwalk`, `snmpset`, `snmptrap`...

‚û°Ô∏è A company can use both SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, it allows a softer migration, but it increases the complexity of the task.

### SNMPv3

Migrating to SNMPv3 can be hard, but it may be required to comply with some regulations <small>(PCI DSS, HIPAA)</small>. Overall it's more robust, performant, reliable and secure.

* ‚ùå some device may not be compatible with SNMPv3
* ‚ùå employees need to learn SNMPv3 <small>(cost/...)</small>
* ‚úÖ the provider <small>(ex: CISCO, IBM, SolarWinds...)</small> can provide some seamless support to upgrade from SNMPv2c
* ‚úÖ SNMPv3 has a more reliable error-management system
* ‚úÖ SNMPv3 has a more secure <small>(integrity checks, encryption, access management with USM/VACM, authentication...)</small>
* ‚úÖ SNMPv3 is more performant

Commands: `snmpget`, `snmpwalk`, `snmpset`, `snmpinform`...

## üëª To-do üëª

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* SNMP ACLs (SNMP tcp/161)
  * ip/range of ips
  * a version of SNMP
  * a community (SNMPv2c?)
