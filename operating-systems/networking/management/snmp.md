# Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an old protocol from 1990-2000 that is still quite used by companies to manage and monitor network devices <small>(routers, switch, firewalls...)</small>.

The goal is to ensure that network devices are operating efficiently and effectively in real-time.

‚û°Ô∏è SNMP uses the port 161 (TCP/UDP).

### Knowledge

One if the components is the Management Information Base (MIB) which is used to store information about devices. This is a tree-like structure with each node called an object carrying information like the number of packet that transited by this node, the CPU utilization of a server...

A agent is a module that runs on a network device and store information about the device inside the MIB.

The SNMP manager is a software that retrieves data from the MIB by interacting with the agent associated with the device. It runs on a network management system (NMS).

The SNMP manager can also send instructions to the agent to set or change the values of objects. The agent will update its associated device to match the instruction.

Agents can send messages also known as "traps" without being request, for instance, when a problem is detected.

### Configuration

You can configure SNMP on a Windows Server with ADDS. You can also configure the server using commands too such as

* `show snmp`: display the current configuration
* `snmp-server community [...]`: configure a community
* `no snmp-server community [...]`: delete a community
* `snmp-server location [...]`: set the location <small>(for humans)</small>
* `snmp-server host [...]`: define the hosts <small>(for traps...)</small>

### SNMPv2c

SNMPv2c is still used by some companies even if it's advised to use SNMPv3 as the latter is more secure. SNMPv2c

* ‚ùå is not scalable. Companies will experience performance problems that may lead to longer delays, and decrease the employees' efficiency.
* ‚ùå is not reliable: error messages can be misinterpreted as they may be incomplete or incorrect.
* ‚ùå is vulnerable: spoofing, tampering, sniffing...
* ‚úÖ Community strings can be set up. They are password-like string, that need to be complex and changed regularly. Only those with the correct community string can fetch data from a network device. By default, anyone can fetch data it. A community can be read-only (RO) or Read-Write (RW).

Commands: `snmpget`, `snmpwalk`, `snmpset`, `snmptrap`...

‚û°Ô∏è A company can use both SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, it allows a softer migration, but it increases the complexity of the task.

### SNMPv3

Migrating to SNMPv3 can be hard, but it may be required to comply with some regulations <small>(PCI DSS, HIPAA)</small>. Overall it's more robust, performant, reliable and secure.

* ‚ùå some device may not be compatible with SNMPv3
* ‚ùå employees need to learn SNMPv3 <small>(cost/...)</small>
* ‚úÖ the provider <small>(ex: CISCO, IBM, SolarWinds...)</small> can provide some seamless support to upgrade from SNMPv2c
* ‚úÖ SNMPv3 has a more reliable error-management system
* ‚úÖ SNMPv3 has a more secure <small>(integrity checks, encryption, access management with USM/VACM, authentication...)</small>
* ‚úÖ SNMPv3 is more performant

Commands: `snmpget`, `snmpwalk`, `snmpset`, `snmpinform`...

## üëª To-do üëª

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* SNMP ACLs (SNMP tcp/161)
  * ip/range of ips
  * a version of SNMP
  * a community (SNMPv2c?)
