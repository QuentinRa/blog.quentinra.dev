Ethernet is a widely used technology in LAN networks. Usually, devices are connected to a switch/hub using Ethernet.

Ethernet is based on IEEE 802.3 standard. It uses a "Carrier sensitive multiple access with collision detection" or **CSMA/CP** in short, to avoid collisions ðŸ’¥.

If both the switch and the machine try to send a message at the same time, then both messages are colluding, and are destroyed ðŸ”¥. To avoid that, following the CSMA/CP, 

* âœ… each device listens for traffic before sending messages
* ðŸ’¥ If there is a collision, each device signal that they will re-send the message after waiting a random amount of time
