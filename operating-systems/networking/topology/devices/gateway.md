# Gateway

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Gateways, also rarely called Jumpoint, are devices connecting two networks. A gateway is similar to a [router](routers.md), aside from the fact that is cannot do routing.

⚠️ The logical notion of "gateway" used in routing table, refer to another network device, such as a Router, not necessarily a Gateway.

Both routers and gateways can do:

* 👮 filter incoming/outgoing traffic
* 🌫️ block traffic/hide a sender
* 💵 Prioritize traffic
* 🔮 Convert protocols
* ...

## Network filters

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Network filters are behaviors applied to a packet matching predefined rules. This section will highly refer to the command `iptables`.

This command is using tables, the most widely used are **filter packets** (filter), and **network address translation** (NAT). Each table is made of sets of **chains** which are statements "`<expression> <action>`"

* `expression`: is a condition, that if false, will trigger action
* `action`: an action on the packet (filter/NAT), or another chain
</div><div>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Table "filter"</summary>

This table is used to accept, or drop a packet. There are 3 chains, according to what packets are doing

* **FORWARD**: packets are transiting/passing by this machine
* **INPUT**: packets that have this machine for destination
* **OUTPUT**: packets that have been emitted from this machine

And you have actions such as **ACCEPT/DENY/DROP/...** to drop a packet.

For instance, this command will DROP any packet using the protocol TCP, on the port 22, which has our machine as the destination, emitted by `172.16.1.1`.

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t filter -A INPUT -s 172.16.1.1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
```

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Table "NAT"</summary>

This table is used to modify the IP_SRC, or IP_DEST, usually referred to as translating, mostly to allow machines to communicate with each other, without being aware of which machine they are communicating with.

![NAT](../_images/nat.png)

In the schema above, host1 wants to allow PC1, and PC2 to communicate, but doesn't want PC2 to know that messages are from PC1. When host1 receives a message from PC1, it will replace PC1 address (source) with its own address, and send it to PC2. When receiving a reply from PC2, it will replace its address (dest) with PC1 address, and send the reply to PC1.

Another case, is that if a machine inside your network is sending a message to the outside world, instead of exposing your machines' IP addresses, you could only expose your host IP address by using NAT.

There are 3 chains

* **POSTROUTING**: change source (action: SNAT)
* **PREROUTING**: change destination (action: DNAT)
* **OUTPUT**: applied on locally generated packets

For instance, this command will hide the IP addresses of pc1, and pc2, using host1 IP address (50.50.50.50), when they are sending a packet to the world using the network interface "eth2".

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t NAT -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -j SNAT --to-source 50.50.50.50
```
