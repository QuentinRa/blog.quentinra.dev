# Proxy

[Go back](../index.md#networking-devices)

There are multiple types of proxy, and their features are different.

#### Open proxy

An open proxy, also called dedicated or forward proxy, is a proxy that is filtering outgoing traffic.

For instance, between users of a company, and the internet, a company may set up an open proxy to prevent users from accessing some websites.

‚û°Ô∏è They can be anonymous <small>(hide requester)</small> or not <small>(transparent)</small>.

üöÄ Transparent proxies can cache frequently accessed resources.

#### Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy is the opposite of an open proxy. Instead of filtering outgoing traffic, it filters incoming traffic.

‚û°Ô∏è A reverse proxy can act as a [Load balancer](balancer.md).

‚û°Ô∏è A reverse proxy can act as a [WAF](firewall.md).

#### Protocols

‚û°Ô∏è See the [SOCKS](../../protocols/socks.md) proxy protocol.
