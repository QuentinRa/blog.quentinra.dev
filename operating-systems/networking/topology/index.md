Network topology is the physical or logical layout of a network. It impact performance, reliability, scalability, and security.

## Physical network topology

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Star Topology ✨

All devices are only connected to a central networking device (hub or switch), forming a star. It's simple to set up, but require many cables. A problem in the central device will impact the whole network. 

#### Bus Topology 🚌

All devices are connected to a single "backbone" cable also called "bus". If a lot of packets are sent at the same time, the cable most likely be saturated. It's simple and rather cheap to set in place.

#### Ring/Token Topology 💍

Each device is connected to another one, forming a loop. Packets are only moving in one direction, meaning that sometimes packets will do a whole loop before reaching their target, which is not efficient, but it also means that there is no collision. If a computer/cable is faulty, then the loop is broken.

#### Mesh Topology 🦴

Each device is connected to every other. It's efficient, and resilient, but costly and hard to maintain.

#### Hybrid Topology 🤖

Combine two or more network topologies according to the need. It can be harder to maintain, but more appropriate for the company.
