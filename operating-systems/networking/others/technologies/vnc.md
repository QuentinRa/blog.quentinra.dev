Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop-sharing system similar to [RDP](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/rdp.md), but using the RFB protocol.

It can optionally allow the remote user to control the keyboard and the mouse, on top of the remote computer.

üêäÔ∏è **Port**: 5900 (TCP)

You can use [remmina](../../protocols/rdp.md) for VNC. Simply select VNC instead of RDP in the dropdown next to the IP address field.
