Cisco is company that specializes in the development of networking devices along other products. This includes:

* 🌍 Routers
* 🛣️ Switches
* 🔥 Firewalls
* ...
</div><div>

Cisco switches and routers support [ACLs](/operating-systems/networking/security/_knowledge/index.md#access-control-lists-acls). We call standard ACLs the ones in `[1-99, 1300-1999]`, in contrast those in `[100-199, 2000-2699]` that we refer to as extended ACLs. Some commands:

```shell!
> show access-lists
> access-list 10 remark Some text here.
> access-list 10 permit 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 # std
> access-list 103 permit tcp 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80 # extended
> access-list 103 permit tcp 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 any eq ftp
> access-list 101 permit tcp host 192.168.1.100 any eq www
> access-list 101 deny ip any any
> no access-list 10 # delete
```
