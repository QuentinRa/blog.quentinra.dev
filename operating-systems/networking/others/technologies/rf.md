# Radio Frequencies

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Radio Frequencies are electromagnetic signals sent over a specific frequency such as 60 kilohertz (kHz).

To send our data over a communication channel, such as radio waves, we often use one modulation techniques among:

* **Amplitude Modulation (AM)** üì¢
* **Frequency Modulation (FM)** üìª

FM as a few more advantages like it's more efficient.

## Manipulating RF Recordings

#### GNU Radio

[GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) is a suite of radio tools such as `gnuradio-companion` graphical editor that can be used to work on radio captures.

```shell!
$ sudo apt install -y gnuradio
$ gnuradio-companion
```

The right panel contains a list of components that we can drag to the main panel. For instance, drag a `File Source` and double-click on it to make it point to your capture. Set the type to `FLOAT`.

To hear a sound, we could use a `Audio Sink`. Connect both, and don't forget to set the type to `FLOAT` and try to find the `SampleRate`. You can enter arbitrary values such as `50000` for `50 kHz`.

#### Python

We could use the [soundfile](https://python-soundfile.readthedocs.io/) library:

```py
# pip install soundfile sounddevice numpy
import soundfile as sf
import sounddevice as sd

sig, fs = sf.read('<AM recording>', channels=1, samplerate=50000, format='RAW', subtype='FLOAT', endian='LITTLE')
sd.play(sig, fs, blocking=True)
```

#### Additional tools

* Audacity may work for some transmissions
* We can use `aplay` from `alsa-utils`:

```shell!
$ cat <AM recording> | aplay -f FLOAT_LE -r <sample rate>
```
