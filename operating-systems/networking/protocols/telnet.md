Telnet is a protocol to communicate with another computer. It can be used to send messages in any protocols, as long as you use the protocol "language", which is often hard.

üêäÔ∏è **Port**: 23 (TCP)

üî• Telnet communications are not encrypted.

```ps
$ telnet IP port
# 1. the server sends the protocol banner
# 2. the user writes text while following the protocol
```

As an example, for HTTP version 1.1, you can write

```ps
$ telnet IP 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
# leave two blank lines (press ENTER twice)
```
