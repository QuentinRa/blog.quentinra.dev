The Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that allows voice transmissions and multimedia communications over the Internet.

It involves a few protocols.

#### Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) üîê

The SIP protocol is quite used to VoIP authentication, from initiating, to managing, and terminating sessions. 

**Ports** üê≤: TCP/5060 and TCP/5061

‚ò†Ô∏è We may be able to enumerate users.

‚ò†Ô∏è We can try to brute force credentials using [sipcrack](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/sipcrack/sipcrack.1.en.html) while they may be transferred as plaintext.

```shell!
$ sudo apt install sipcrack
$ sipcrack -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt message
```

#### H.323

#### Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)

The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used for delivering audio and video over IP networks in real-time. It's often used with RTCP.

**Ports** üê≤: 

* RDP: usually an even port number (TCP)
* RTCP: usually RDP port + 1 (TCP)
