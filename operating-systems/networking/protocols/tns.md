Transparent Network Substrate (TNS) is a protocol owned and developed by Oracle. It's mainly used to manage [Oracle Databases](/programming-languages/databases/relational/dbms/oracle.md). 

It includes performance monitoring and analysis, error reporting, and logging tools. It supports a wide range of networking protocols such as IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, IPV6, and SSL/TLS. Communications are encrypted.

üêäÔ∏è **Port**: 1521 (TCP)

The server-side service that listens for clients is called a listener. Its configuration determines which networking protocols are allowed.
