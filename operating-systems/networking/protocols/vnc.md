Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a protocol used to access a  desktop with a graphical interface from another computer over a network connection. It's similar to  [RDP](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/rdp.md). It uses the RFB protocol.

It can optionally allow the remote user to control the keyboard and the mouse, on top of the remote computer.

üêäÔ∏è **Port**: 5900 (TCP)

You can use [remmina](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/rdp.md) for VNC. Select VNC instead of RDP in the dropdown next to the IP address field.
