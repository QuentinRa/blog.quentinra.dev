<summary><b>Ethernet</b>: a cable to connect a device to a Hub/Switch.</summary>

Instead of connecting nodes/devices to each other, they all are connected to a switch/hub using Ethernet (norm IEE 802.3). They are using a technique called "Carrier sensitive multiple access with collision detection", or **CSMA/CP** in short, to handle collisions.

If both the switch and the machine try to send a message at the same time, then both messages are colluding, and are destroyed
  * each other signal that they will re-send the message
  * each network card has its own delay before sending a message again
  * the machine/switch sends the message first, and there is hopefully no problem this time

<summary>Subnetwork, subnet, subnetting: divide your network</summary>

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Dividing a network into subnetworks/subnet (`sous-rÃ©seaux`), is called **subnetting**. For instance, given a network address, you may split it into $n$ subnetworks. In such case

* each network will have its own netmask, and broadcast address <small>(the "minus 2" when counting IPs)</small>
* it means that each network will have $2^{32-n} - 2$ addresses, with $n$ the number of fixed bits

The process is a bit complicated to explain ðŸ˜¢, please read the example too. Your current network address has $N$ fixed bits. Let's say you want to divide your network so that there are $x$ subnetworks.

* Find the lowest $n$ solving $2^n \ge x$
* If $N + n \ge 32$, then you can't
* Each network will have $2^{(32âˆ’N-n)}âˆ’2$ IP addresses
* Each network is made by permutations of the newly added $n$ bits
</div><div>

Example: Given $172.16.254.0/23$, we have $N = 23$, and we want to divide our network in $x=2$. Currently, your network can host $2^{32-23} - 2 = 512 - 2 = 510$. Dividing the network won't give us $255$ per subnet...

* $2^{1} \ge 2$ giving us $n=1$
* $22 + 1 \le 32$, so we can split our network in two
* Each network will have $2^{(32âˆ’23-1)}âˆ’2 = 254$ IP addresses
* $172.16.254.0/23$ will be split in
  * $172.16.254.0/24$ <small>(the 24th bit is 0)</small>
  * $172.16.255.0/24$ <small>(the 24th bit is 1)</small>

> **Subnets** are a logical way of dividing a network, while **network segments** are a physical way of doing so.
