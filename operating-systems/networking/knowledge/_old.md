# Networking

We call a network of devices "internet", and what we refer to (THE) "Internet" are many small networks all joined together.

<summary>Imunes - free open-source network emulator</summary>
<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[**imunes**](http://imunes.net/) is a free open-source network emulator in which you can create nodes (hosts, switches, routers...), connect them, add rules (see iptables), and send requests from one computer to another, mostly to test your network configuration.

```bash
$ sudo imunes &
```

You may have multiple sessions.

```bash
$ imunes image -l # list
$ imunes -b -e <id> # kill
```

> There are a lot of newer (and better?) alternatives...
</div><div>

Using the graphical interface

* <kbd>experiment | execute</kbd>: run simulation
* <kbd>experiment | terminate</kbd>: terminate simulation
* <kbd>double-click on a host</kbd>: open a terminal on the host
* <kbd>right-click on a node | configure</kbd>: setup rules <small>(routing, ARP)</small>
  * enable "custom startup config"

## LAN, and WAN networks

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Wide area network** (WAN, `rÃ©seau mondial/Ã©tendu`) is every network outside your LAN network.

**Local Area Network** (LAN, `rÃ©seau domestique`) is a network established within a limited area, such as your home.

**Router**: a device usually connecting a LAN network, with a WAN network. It does "routing", meaning selecting the route/path that packets will take to arrive at the destination.

**Hub/Switch**: a device which can be connected to usually at least 4, and up to 64 devices, using Ethernet. They are receiving packets from others hosts, and they handle the delivery of packets while ensuring that they are received in the right order, and are not corrupted.

<details class="details-n">
<summary><b>Ethernet</b>: a cable to connect a device to a Hub/Switch.</summary>

Instead of connecting nodes/devices to each other, they all are connected to a switch/hub using Ethernet (norm IEE 802.3). They are using a technique called "Carrier sensitive multiple access with collision detection", or **CSMA/CP** in short, to handle collisions.

If both the switch and the machine try to send a message at the same time, then both messages are colluding, and are destroyed
  * each other signal that they will re-send the message
  * each network card has its own delay before sending a message again
  * the machine/switch sends the message first, and there is hopefully no problem this time
</details>
</div><div>

**Network topologies** are different ways of connecting devices in a network.

* **Star Topology**: all devices are connected to a central networking device such as a switch or hub

* **Bus Topology**: a single cable "backbone cable", and all devices connect to the cable. If a lot of packets are sent, the cable most likely be saturated.

* **Ring/Token Topology**: each computer is connected to another one, forming a loop. Packets are only moving in one direction, meaning that sometimes packets will do a whole loop (not efficient). If a computer/cable is faulty, then the loop is broken.

## Network interface

As a machine may have multiple network cards, or a network card may be connected to multiple networks, you have to determine which interface will be used for each communication.

## IPV4 addresses

Internet Protocol version 4 (**IPV4**) addresses are **32-bits long addresses**.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Dot-decimal notation (<code>Notation dÃ©cimale pointÃ©e</code>, DDN)</summary>

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

This is the most-known representation of an IPV4 address. We are splitting ours **32 bits** into **4 groups of 8 bits** called **bytes**/octets (`octet`), we are converting them to decimal, and separated with a **dot**.

* Starting with a binary IP <small>(ex: `0101100010[...]01`)</small>
* We are ending with **n.n.n.n** <small>(with each $n \in \[0,\ 255]$)</small>
* Example: `127.0.0.1`

</div><div class="align-self-center">

Given this IP (binary): `01001101001000011110000100000000`

* Split into 4 blocs: `01001101`, `00100001`, `11100001`, and `00000000`
* We convert each bloc: `77`, `33`, `225`, and `0`
* We separate them with a dot: `77.33.225.0`
* [Online tool to convert bin to IP](https://www.browserling.com/tools/bin-to-ip)
</div></div>
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>id_net, id_host, and network address</summary>

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The bits in the IP address are actually separated into 2 parts

* **id_net**: a fixed part for every address in a network, that is used to identify the network
* **id_host**: every remaining bit. Pointing to a host in a network, but if there are only null bits (0), then this is the **address of the network**.

You can't guess the number of fixed bits, either it is given by an organism <small>(such as your ISP)</small>, or you are given something called the netmask which is explained a bit further.
</div><div>

Example: is xxx a network address?

We consider the IP `01001101001000011110000100000000` (`77.33.225.0`). We are told that the fixed part is 17 bits long.

* id_net: `01001101001000011` (17 bits)
* id_host: `110000100000000` (32-17=15 bits)

The id_host has non-null bits, so it's not a network address.
</div></div>
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)</summary>
<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

It is a way to write/share an IP address along the number of bits of the fixed part. The syntax is `IP/n`, such as `192.168.0.0/12`.

* `IP` is the network address
* `n` is the number of fixed bits

> Traditionally, before CIDR, n could only be 8, 16, or 24. They were called A-class, B-class, and C-class networks, used respectively by big, medium, and small-scale organizations. Unfortunately, there was a very fast shortage of B-class networks, which leads to CIDR which has a flexible network size.
</div><div>

We have the address `01001101001000011110000100000000` (`77.33.225.0`). We were told that there are 24 fixed bits.

* We are extracting 24 bits from the address: `010011010010000111100001`
* We are filling the missing bits with `0` (32-24=8): `01001101001000011110000100000000`
* We are converting the bits to DDN: `77.33.225.0`
* We are adding `/24`: `77.33.225.0/24`

The CIDR notation is `77.33.225.0/24`.
</div></div>
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>netmask (<code>Masque de sous-rÃ©seau</code>)</summary>

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

This IP address is called a mask, as it was not created to be assigned to a machine, but to find the number of fixed bits in another IP address.

* We are writing $n$ <small>(=number of fixed bits)</small> non-null bits (1)
* We are filling the remaining bits with null bits (0)

If we know that `77.33.225.0` has 24 fixed bits, then we will write 24 times "1", and 8 <small>(32-24)</small> times "0", giving us `11111111111111111111111100000000` which is `255.255.255.0`.
</div><div>

It's even easier to find the netmask. <small>Example with `77.33.128.0/17`.</small>

* Calculate $\frac{n}{8}$ (<small>$\frac{17}{8}$ gives us $q=2$, $r=1$</small>)
* Calculate $c=255-2^{8-r} + 1$ (<small>$c=255-2^{8-1}=128$</small>)
* The result is
  * $q$ times $255$ <small>(2 times $255$)</small>
  * 1 time $c$ <small>(1 times $128$)</small>
  * and $\min(4-q-1, 0)$ times $0$  <small>(1 times $0$)</small>
* <small>Giving us $255.255.128.0$</small>
</div></div>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>broadcast mask (<code>Masque de diffusion</code>)</summary>

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

This mask is used to send a message to EVERY machine in the network. 

We are simply filling the **id_host** with non-null bits (1).
</div><div>

Given the IP `77.33.225.0/24`,

* id_net: `010011010010000111100001` (extract 24 bits)
* id_host: `11111111` (fill last 8 bits with 1)

Giving us `01001101001000011110000111111111` which is `77.33.225.255`.

<summary>Reserved/Private IP addresses</summary>

There are 3 ranges of IPV4 addresses that are said private/reserved for internal use

<summary>Subnetwork, subnet, subnetting: divide your network</summary>

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Dividing a network into subnetworks/subnet (`sous-rÃ©seaux`), is called **subnetting**. For instance, given a network address, you may split it into $n$ subnetworks. In such case

* each network will have its own netmask, and broadcast address <small>(the "minus 2" when counting IPs)</small>
* it means that each network will have $2^{32-n} - 2$ addresses, with $n$ the number of fixed bits

The process is a bit complicated to explain ðŸ˜¢, please read the example too. Your current network address has $N$ fixed bits. Let's say you want to divide your network so that there are $x$ subnetworks.

* Find the lowest $n$ solving $2^n \ge x$
* If $N + n \ge 32$, then you can't
* Each network will have $2^{(32âˆ’N-n)}âˆ’2$ IP addresses
* Each network is made by permutations of the newly added $n$ bits
</div><div>

Example: Given $172.16.254.0/23$, we have $N = 23$, and we want to divide our network in $x=2$. Currently, your network can host $2^{32-23} - 2 = 512 - 2 = 510$. Dividing the network won't give us $255$ per subnet...

* $2^{1} \ge 2$ giving us $n=1$
* $22 + 1 \le 32$, so we can split our network in two
* Each network will have $2^{(32âˆ’23-1)}âˆ’2 = 254$ IP addresses
* $172.16.254.0/23$ will be split in
  * $172.16.254.0/24$ <small>(the 24th bit is 0)</small>
  * $172.16.255.0/24$ <small>(the 24th bit is 1)</small>

> **Subnets** are a logical way of dividing a network, while **network segments** are a physical way of doing so.

## IPV6 addresses

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The Internet Protocol version 6 (**IPV6**) address is a **128-bit long address**. It was introduced because of the shortage of IPV4. It's also more efficient due to new technologies.

It looks like this: `2002:6963:6961:2046:616c:636f:6e20:3c33`, which is 8 blocks of 16 bits, separated with `:`. Because it's somewhat long, there are a few rules to shorten it

* Any leading $0$ in a block can be removed <small>(`0014 -> 14`)</small>
* A whole block of $0$ can be replaced with one $0$ <small>(`0000 -> 0`)</small>
* **One**, and only one suite of null-groups, may be merged in `::` <small>(`...:0000:0000:... -> ...::...`)</small>
</div><div>

There are 8 kinds of IPV6 addresses

| Type/Name                        | Prefix (128 bits) | IPV6 notation            |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Unspecified (`non spÃ©cifiÃ©`)     | 0...0             | ::/128                   |
| LoopBack (=localhost)            | 0...01            | ::1/128                  |
| Multicast (=broadcast)           | 111111110...0     | ff00::/8                 |
| Multicast (using ARP)            |                   | ff02::/8                 |
| Link-local Unicast (subnet only) | 1111111110...0    | ff80::/10                |
| Unique local Unicast (private)   | 11111101...0      | ffd0:://8<br>ffc0::/7    |
| Global Unicast (Internet)        | ...               | 2001..<br>2002...<br>... |

## Routing table

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

When a machine wants to send a packet to another one, the **routing table** will be used to determine

* if we can send the packet directly to the destination
* or, which machine can we ask to do the delivery

![Routing table](_images/routing_table.png)

You can relate this table to a (switch) case statement that exists in many programming languages.

* The IP will try each destination. The GenMask (Netmask) will be used to get the **network address**. Then, if the IP is within the network range, then we will use this destination.
* If no destination is found, then `0.0.0.0` , will be used. It's leading to what we call the **Default Gateway**, which is usually ending with either ".1" or ".254".
</div><div>

Once you found a destination, the **gateway** indicates how you can reach it. If the gateway is `0.0.0.0`, then it means that you can directly send the packet (LAN). Otherwise, you have to send the packet to the IP stored in the field "gateway".

Another thing that you should take note of is **Iface**, which is the network interface that will be used to send the packet.
</div></div>

<hr class="sr">

## Network filters

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Network filters are behaviors applied to a packet matching predefined rules. This section will highly refer to the command `iptables`. 

This command is using tables, the most widely used are **filter packets** (filter), and **network address translation** (NAT). Each table is made of sets of **chains** which are statements "`<expression> <action>`"

* `expression`: is a condition, that if false, will trigger action
* `action`: an action on the packet (filter/NAT), or another chain
</div><div>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Table "filter"</summary>

This table is used to accept, or drop a packet. There are 3 chains, according to what packets are doing

* **FORWARD**: packets are transiting/passing by this machine
* **INPUT**: packets that have this machine for destination
* **OUTPUT**: packets that have been emitted from this machine

And you have actions such as **ACCEPT/DENY/DROP/...** to drop a packet. 

For instance, this command will DROP any packet using the protocol TCP, on the port 22, which has our machine as the destination, emitted by `172.16.1.1`.

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t filter -A INPUT -s 172.16.1.1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Table "NAT"</summary>

This table is used to modify the IP_SRC, or IP_DEST, usually referred to as translating, mostly to allow machines to communicate with each other, without being aware of which machine they are communicating with.

![NAT](_images/nat.png)

In the schema above, host1 wants to allow PC1, and PC2 to communicate, but doesn't want PC2 to know that messages are from PC1. When host1 receives a message from PC1, it will replace PC1 address (source) with its own address, and send it to PC2. When receiving a reply from PC2, it will replace its address (dest) with PC1 address, and send the reply to PC1. 

Another case, is that if a machine inside your network is sending a message to the outside world, instead of exposing your machines' IP addresses, you could only expose your host IP address by using NAT. 

There are 3 chains

* **POSTROUTING**: change source (action: SNAT)
* **PREROUTING**: change destination (action: DNAT)
* **OUTPUT**: applied on locally generated packets

For instance, this command will hide the IP addresses of pc1, and pc2, using host1 IP address (50.50.50.50), when they are sending a packet to the world using the network interface "eth2".

```bash
$ sudo iptables -t NAT -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -j SNAT --to-source 50.50.50.50
```
