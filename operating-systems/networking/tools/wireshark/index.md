See [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Wireshark is providing a graphical interface. Inside the search bar, you can filter requests/responses

* `ip.src == some_IP`, or `ip.dest == some_IP`
* `ip.addr == some_IP`
* `tcp.port == some_port`, or `udp.port == some_port`
* `http.request.method == GET`, or `... == POST`...
* You can use `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), `!=` (different)
* You can enter a protocol, or `tcp`/`udp`

Once you find something interesting, right-click on it > Follow TCP Stream, and you will see in a human-readable way the data exchanged.

Use File > Export > HTTP to GET download files.
