# Knowledge about Linux

<b>Open a terminal</b>

> * Look for "Terminal" in your Applications
> * Or, use the shortcut `CTRL+SHIFT+T`

<b>Increase/Decrease Zoom</b>

> Use `CTRL +`, and `CTRL -` to increase/decrease zoom

<b>Console mode</b> ü§ï - beginner killer

> You can use CTRL+ALT+F1 to swap to console mode <small>(from F1, up to F6)</small>, while you can use ALT+F7 to swap back ü§§.

<b>Paste something</b>

> Usually, the scroll button will paste any copied content.

> There is no "echo" when writing a password, so don't be confused when you are writing one.

## Paths

* `/etc` (folder): "commonplace location to store system files that are used by your operating system"
* `/dev/null` (file): an empty file, a sort of trash file in which everything you write inside is deleted.
* `/etc/shadow` (file): username, and their hashed password
* `/etc/gshadow` (file), and `/etc/group`: groups
* `/var/log/` (folder): log files
* `/mnt` (folder): mounted device/hard drives (D:, USB...)
* `/tmp` (folder): a trash folder cleaned on reboot

XXX

* **Remember** that if you have spaces in your paths, then you must either quote them, or use `\` before any space.
* If you met a crazy guy that named something starting with a `-`, then you need to use `--` before the weird filename. For instance: `cp -- -filename`.

## List of essential Linux commands

* you can use `xdg-open` to open a PDF, or an URL.

<details class="details-e">
<summary><code>tee</code>: read input, and output input</summary>

It's most likely more proper to use this than `cat` to output the content of a file.

```bash
$ tee < file
```

But the useful usage of tee is taking one input, and sending the output to many destinations.

```bash
$ tee output1 output2 < file
# also shows the content of the file here
$ tee output1 output2
Hello # CTRL-D
Hello
```
