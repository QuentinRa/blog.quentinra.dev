Linux is a family of Unix-like operating systems, often called distros, such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch Linux... They were designed to be free, open-source, light, secure, and performant.

➡️ Each distro has its pro and cons according to what specific usage they were designed for <small>(ex: gaming, security, performance...)</small>.

Linux in its simplest form is a **command-line interface** (CLI), commonly referred to as terminal/shell <small>(or console/command prompt)</small>.

Inside the CLI, we can run commands interpreted by a **shell** 🐚.  There are multiple shell languages <small>(sh, csh, tcsh, ksh, bash)</small>, however most Linux distributions are using **bash** <small>(bourne again shell)</small> 🔥. Most shell languages are improved versions of sh 🪦.

👉 Note that shell, the CLI, and a terminal are not the same thing, although they are closely related, hence the common misuse.
