# Linux Graphic User Interface

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

The traditional graphics server for Linux used to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) is the **X Window System** (X11, 6000/TCP).

Modern systems are moving to Wayland.

Applications are rendered by a Window Manager which is optionally managed by a desktop environment. The graphical data is sent to the server which passes it to the graphical hardware.
