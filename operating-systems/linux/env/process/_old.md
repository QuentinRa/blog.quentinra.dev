#### Foreground and background processes

[![linuxfundamentalspart1](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/linuxfundamentalspart1.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1)

A foreground process is a process receiving input from the user, while a background process is running but not receiving input.

They can only be one foreground process at a time inside a session. We use background processes to run long task not requiring user input. Background processes

* ðŸ˜µ can't read, and may not be able to write on the terminal
* ðŸ”• aren't receiving signals, except **CTRL-Z** (suspend)

To run a command in the background, use `&`:

```shell!
$ sleep 10 &
```

* use `&` to run a process in the background
