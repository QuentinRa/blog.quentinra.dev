# Basics

Every linux command is a **process**. A box can be viewed as a box with

* 📄 a code to execute 
* 🪸 an environment <small>(file descriptors, parameters, permissions...)</small>
* 🧪 some data <small>(stack, variables...)</small>

While you can learn more about [processes here](/operating-systems/linux/architecture/index.md#processes-and-scheduling), some important takeaway are:

* processes returns `0` if successful ✅, and `not 0` otherwise ❌.
* each process has a unique identifier called `pid`

Commands usually have an option "help".
