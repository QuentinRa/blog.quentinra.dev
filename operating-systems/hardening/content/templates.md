# OVAL checks

[Go back](../index.md)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There are many [existing templates](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates/template_reference.html) which you can use in your rules. They are located in `shared/templates`, see each `oval.template` file.

You will also write a check only for one rule. In some rule folder, create a file `shared.xml` giving us: `<rule_folder>/oval/shared.xml`.

ðŸ”¥ There are some differences if the check is a template or not.
