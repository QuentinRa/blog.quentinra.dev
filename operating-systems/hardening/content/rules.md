# Rules

[Go back](../index.md)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A rule link every information related to the hardening rule. It's described in a `rule.yml`. It defines stuff like:

* 🌱 Description <small>(ex: explain what's this rule about)</small>
* 🔎 Rule check <small>(ex: test if the rule was applied)</small>
* 🧯 Remediation utility <small>(ex: bash script, note...)</small>
* 🌍 Applicability check <small>(ex: package is not present ️→ rule not applicable)</small>
* 🔒 Product check <small>(ex: can this rule be used with this product?)</small>
* ...

A rule is stored in a folder. The folder name is the **rule id**.

Below is the rule `file_groupowner_etc_passwd`.

```
./linux_os/guide/system/permissions/files/permissions_important_account_files/file_groupowner_etc_passwd/
```

Rules are stored in groups, e.g. its parent folders, which all have a `group.yml`. You can place a rule in whatever folder you see fit.

## 👻 To-do 👻

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

By default, all rules that are loaded in a profile, are considered to be applicable on a product. But, if that's not the case, then each rule should specify the condition in the `platform:` attribute. [Documentation](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/developer/06_contributing_with_content.html#applicability-by-cpe).

* `/content/shared/applicability`
* New type, inventory
* `platform: your_check`
</div><div>

* `<rule_name>/rule.yml`
* [format](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/developer/06_contributing_with_content.html#rules)
* `<br />`
* `<tt>xxx</tt>`
* `<pre>xxx</pre>`

```yaml!
template:
    name: your_template_name
    vars:
        xxx: yyy
        xxx@zzz: yyy
```

**Warnings** ⚠️

* ☠️ If the `prodtype` attribute is present, you'll either get an error during build <small>(unselects all groups)</small>

* ☠️ If there is a problem with the documentation <small>(ex: `<br>` which is a missing auto-closing slash)</small>, build will fail at step 9.
