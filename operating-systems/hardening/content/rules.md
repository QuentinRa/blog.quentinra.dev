# Rules

[Go back](../index.md)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A rule link every information related to the hardening rule. It's described in a `rule.yml`. It defines stuff like:

* üå± Description <small>(ex: explain what's this rule about)</small>
* üîé Rule check <small>(ex: test if the rule was applied)</small>
* üßØ Remediation utility <small>(ex: bash script, note...)</small>
* üåç Applicability check <small>(ex: package is not present Ô∏è‚Üí rule not applicable)</small>
* üîí Product check <small>(ex: can this rule be used with this product?)</small>
* ...

A rule is stored in a folder. The folder name is the **rule id**.

Below is the rule `file_groupowner_etc_passwd`.

```
./linux_os/guide/system/permissions/files/permissions_important_account_files/file_groupowner_etc_passwd/
```

Rules are stored in groups, e.g. its parent folders, which all have a `group.yml`. You can place a rule in whatever folder you see fit.

## prodtype and platform

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

If there is a `prodtype` attribute, then this rule can **only** be used by products that were added in `prodtype`. You can add your product to each rule `prodtype` manually ü§ö, or use a script ü§ñ.

‚û°Ô∏è See [mod_prodtype.py](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/developer/05_tools_and_utilities.html#utils-mod-prodtype-py-programmatically-modify-prodtype-in-rule-yml) or [autoprodtyper.py](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/developer/05_tools_and_utilities.html#utils-autoprodtyper-py-automatically-add-product-to-prodtype). To be able to execute scripts, you need [to execute some commands](compilation.md#scripts) first.

‚ö†Ô∏è When using `autoprodtyper` with controls, it **won't** work.

‚ò†Ô∏è If the `prodtype` attribute is present, you'll get an error during build <small>(unselects all groups...)</small>.

## üëª To-do üëª

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

By default, all rules that are loaded in a profile, are considered to be applicable on a product. But, if that's not the case, then each rule should specify the condition in the `platform:` attribute. [Documentation](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/developer/06_contributing_with_content.html#applicability-by-cpe).

* `/content/shared/applicability`
* New type, inventory
* `platform: your_check`
</div><div>

* `<rule_name>/rule.yml`
* [format](https://complianceascode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/developer/06_contributing_with_content.html#rules)
* `<br />`
* `<tt>xxx</tt>`
* `<pre>xxx</pre>`

```yaml!
template:
    name: your_template_name
    vars:
        xxx: yyy
        xxx@zzz: yyy
```

**Warnings** ‚ö†Ô∏è

* ‚ò†Ô∏è If the `prodtype` attribute is present, you'll get an error during build <small>(unselects all groups)</small>

* ‚ò†Ô∏è If there is a problem with the documentation <small>(ex: `<br>` which is a missing auto-closing slash)</small>, build will fail at step 9.
