<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

OVAL is used by many files in the project, but there are barely any resources to learn about its syntax ðŸ“‰.

The usual template is something like this:

```xml
<def-group>
  <definition class="..." id="..." version="3">
      <criteria>
          <!-- ... -->
      </criteria>
  </definition>
  <!-- ... -->
</def-group>
```
</div><div>
</div></div>
