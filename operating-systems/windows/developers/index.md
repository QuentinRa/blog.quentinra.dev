# Windows For Developers

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Windows is commonly used by developers üçÉ. While it is less convenient than Linux in some ways, there are some ways to make it suitable for developing software and everything else üêä.

* [WSL](#windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl) is commonly used to get a Linux console environment
* [Cygwin or MinGW]() are commonly used to get a Linux console environment or to get `.exe` versions of Linux commands.
* [VSCode](/tools-and-frameworks/editors/vscode/index.md) or [JetBrains](/tools-and-frameworks/editors/jetbrains/_general/index.md) are commonly used as editors to write code
* [WAMP](/operating-systems/webservers/apache/wamp.md) is often used to emulate a webserver for web development
* ...

While not specific to Windows, these are often used instead of the Linux command:

* [FileZilla]() mostly for FTP
* [Putty MobaXTerm...]() mostly for SSH, FTP...
* ...

## Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) is a system that allows us to access a Linux CLI interface. It's basically a [docker](/operating-systems/others/virtualization/docker/index.md).

[Follow the install instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment). Basically, open a PowerShell or a CMD as an admin and install any WSL.

```ps
PS> wsl -l -o
Ubuntu                                 Ubuntu
Debian                                 Debian GNU/Linux
...
PS> wsl --install Debian
```

You can start it as you would with any programs.

üí° You can also download them from the Microsoft Store. Doing so will enable auto-updates for you.

‚ùå WSL don't natively support graphical apps and some commands.

<br>

#### Access WSL files from Windows

You can use the file explorer:

<div class="text-center">

![browse_wsl_files](_images/browse_wsl_files.png)
</div>

> You can also enter the PATH `\\wsl.localhost\` or `\\wsl$`.
</div><div>

#### Graphical interfaces with XMing

[XMing](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/) is a low-quality graphical tool. Install it and [XMing fonts](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/) <small>(scroll to "public domain" to find the download links)</small>. To run graphical apps, you will mostly use `-c` to usual commands that support it.

```shell!
$ subl -c      # sublime text
$ emacs -c     # emacs
$ ./idea.sh -c # IntelliJ
```

<br>

#### Common usage of WSL

Most of the time, we integrate WSL within our code environment üöÄ. For instance, when pressing the compile/run button from your IDE, it will compile/run the code using the WSL.

* [IntelliJ and WSL](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html) (Java IDE)
* [CLion and WSL](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html) (C/C++ IDE)
* [VSCode C/C++ and WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl)
* ...

## InnoSetup

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[InnoSetup](https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc) is a tool to create modern Windows installers. You can download it [here](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) üç¨. Simply install and run the software.

Use the `Create a new file using the Script wizard` wizard. It will generate a `.iss` with the configuration to generate the installer.

#### Target folder

Ex: All files will be stored in the `app` folder.

```diff
-Source: "a\path\to\app\*"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion recursesubdirs createallsubdirs
+Source: "a\path\to\app\*"; DestDir: "{app}\app"; Flags: ignoreversion recursesubdirs createallsubdirs
```
</div><div>

#### CLI options

```ps
PS> file.exe /SILENT      # Only show the progress bar
PS> file.exe /VERYSILENT  # No installer visible
# Add custom options
PS> file.exe /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS="desktopicon,postinstall"
```
