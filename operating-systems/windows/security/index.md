# Windows Security

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Windows has built-in tools and features to increase the security and reduce the attack surface exploitable for hackers.

Formerly known as Windows Defender, Windows Security provides features to help ensure the safety and privacy of the system.

* ü™≤ Antivirus
* üí∞ Ransomware protection
* üî´ Network Firewall
* üîí [SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview)
* ...

It's important to keep the operating system [up to date](/cybersecurity/blue-team/topics/updates.md). Windows Update is responsible for downloading and installing them.

Updates are usually released on the 2nd Tuesday of each month, which is often called "Patch Tuesday."

You can open Windows Update from a terminal using: `control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate`.

Microsoft frequently releases [security updates](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us) for their products.

## Authentication & Authorization

#### Security Accounts Manager (SAM)

The SAM (Security Accounts Manager) database is a local database present on every Windows computer. It is used for authentication. It stores account information including usernames and password hashes.

Modern versions of Windows use the NT hash format, commonly referred to as NTLM, as the previous format was LM.

The database is stored in: `/Windows/System32/config/SAM/` <small>(admin-only)</small>.

#### Security Identifier (SID)

Each object (user, service, etc.) that can be authenticated is called "Security Principal," and has a security identifier (SID). They are used to verify that the user is authorized to an action.

A SID is a concatenation of a domain identifier and a relative identifier (RID). They start with `S-`. The last  hyphen-separated value is the RID.

```ps
PS> whoami /user
PS> wmic useraccount get name,sid
```
</div><div>

#### Access Control

The access to any resources is managed by Access Control Entries (ACEs) in Access Control Lists (ACLs). An ACL is a set of ACEs.

Each ACE specifies the permissions <small>(R, W, X, etc.)</small> granted or denied for a particular user or group <small>(a SID)</small> over a "securable object". A securable object refers to a resource that can be secured <small>(files, services, etc.)</small>.

A security descriptor is a data structure associated with a securable object. It contains information such as:
 
* **Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)**: A list of ACEs 
* **System Access Control List (SACL)**: Optionally, a list that specifies which security events should be audited.

#### Local Security Authority (LSA)

The Local Security Authority (LSA) is a process responsible for security-related functions in the operating system.

* Authenticating users
* Enforcing security policies
* Generating access tokens <small>(contains security information such as privileges, used by processes/... to authorize users)</small>

It's managed by `lsass.exe`, the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).

## Random Notes

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Alternate Data Streams (ADS)

[![adventofcyber2](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/adventofcyber2/day21.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2)

On NTFS filesystem, ADS allows files to have more than one stream of data. By default, every file has one stream called `:$DATA`.

```ps
PS> Get-Item -Path SomeFile -Stream * # list streams
PSPath        : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::XXX\toto.pdf::$DATA
PSParentPath  : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::XXX
PSChildName   : toto.pdf::$DATA
PSDrive       : XXX
PSProvider    : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem
PSIsContainer : False
FileName      : XXX\toto.pdf
Stream        : :$DATA
Length        : 0
```

They can be used by Windows to store data, such as identifiers telling Windows that this file was downloaded from the Internet.

Hackers can use that to store malicious code inside a file. This code may be executed by a vulnerable application loading the file.

```ps
PS> $(Resolve-Path .\file.exe:stream) # vulnerable PS call
```

#### Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)

[![adventofcyber2](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/adventofcyber2/day23.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2)

The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is handling the creation, and management of shadow copies/snapshots of the data backed up. 

It stores data in the "volume information" of each drive that has the feature enabled. They may allow a system admin to restore the system after an attack. Hackers will most likely check them and delete them.

To manage them, right-click on a hard-drive, and select "Shadow copies." Shadow copies can be stored externally.

**BitLocker**

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware component provides security against tampering along with many other things. BitLocker was designed "to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline", as per [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview).

* backup the SAM and SYSTEM hashes
    * `reg save hklm\system C:\XXX\system.hive`
    * `reg save hklm\sam C:\XXX\sam.hive`
* Windows Defender Firewall
  * Block access to share if not in the same workgroup?
* Application Whitelisting 
* AppLocker
* Local Group Policy (gpedit.msc)
