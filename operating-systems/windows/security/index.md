**Windows security** / **Windows defender**

**BitLocker**

The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware component provides security against tampering along with many other things. BitLocker was designed "to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline", as per [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview).
