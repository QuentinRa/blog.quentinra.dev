<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Microsoft Windows is the most used operating system. Windows versions that were quite used are Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, and now Windows 11 is slowly gaining new users.

There are a lot of things that are similar to [Linux Operating systems](/operating-systems/linux/_knowledge/index.md), so I will add fewer details here.

Some dates about the latest versions

* Windows 7 (2009-2020)
* Windows 10 (2015-2025)
* Windows 11 (2021-???)
* Windows 12 (???-???)

## Windows console

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

You can run commands on Windows inside a **CMD** (Command Prompt), or inside a [**PowerShell**](../powershell/index.md). The latter is an improved version of the former, which is retro compatible: commands working in a CMD are, ‚ö†Ô∏èfor most ‚ö†Ô∏è, working inside a PowerShell.

The syntax used **on this website** (üìå):

* `PS>`: commands only available in PowerShell
* `CMD>` commands available in both CMD and PowerShell
* A note is added for other special cases

You can start a CMD with `cmd` or `cmd.exe`. You can start a PowerShell with `powershell` or `powershell.exe`. You can also use

```powershell
CMD> powershell -c "PowerShell command here"
```
</div><div>

**Hint 1**

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è DANGER ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è. There are many aliases in PowerShell, such as `sc` for `Set-Content`. The problem is that some aliases are also CMD commands... An easy path: add `.exe`, such as `sc.exe`.

**Hint 2**

To run administrative commands in a CMD/PowerShell, you need to start it using "Run as administrator".

**Hint 3**

You can open a CMD/PowerShell in a folder by using <kbd>SHIFT+Right-click</kbd> like you would to create a new file, then selecting "Open a PowerShell here".

‚û°Ô∏è Since Windows 11, click on "More options" first.

## CMD commands

[![windowsfundamentals2x0x](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals2x0x.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals2x0x)

If you don't use PowerShell, which is Linux friendly so most Unix commands are available, here are some commands that you will most likely use. See the [comparison of cmdlets with similar commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell#Comparison_of_cmdlets_with_similar_commands). If you need help, use `command /?`, `help command`, `command /help`...

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

* üçÉ `cd`: move to another folder

* üìùÔ∏è `dir`: list files, same as `ls`

* üìñ `type`: print files, same as `cat`

* üßπ `cls`: clear the screen, same as `clear`

* üîé `find`: search files

</div><div>

* üîé `findstr`: search content in files, same as `grep`

* üóÉÔ∏è `move`: move files

* üé£ `curl`: fetch web resources

* üï∏Ô∏è `ipconfig`: see the network configuration

* ü™µ `tree`: display folder structure, same as `tree`

</div></div>

## WMIC

[![windowsfundamentals](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/windowsfundamentals.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-fundamentals)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

[Windows Management Instrumentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page) Command-line (WMIC) is an utility provides a command-line interface for Windows management tasks. Since Windows 10, using powershell is recommended üì¢.

```ps
PS> wmic
wmic:root\cli> # commands are not prefixed by wmic
PS> wmic /?    # show the help
```

Example commands:

* `wmic computersystem`: computer information <small>(`username,domain,name`)</small>
* `wmic os`: OS information <small>(`caption,registeredUser,serialNumber,version`)</small>
* `wmic product`: installed programs
* `wmic logicaldisk`: connected hard drives
* `wmic process`: running processes
* `wmic service`: list services
* `wmic useraccount`: local user accounts
* `wmic group`: local groups
* ...
</div><div>

You can filter attributes using `get`:

```ps
PS> wmic computersystem get username,domain,name
Domain     Name  UserName
WORKGROUP  PC    PC\john
```

You can use `list <format>` to use list display formats:

```ps
PS> wmic os list brief # 6 columns, see "/?"
BuildNumber  Organization  RegisteredUser
SerialNumber SystemDirectory Version
```
</div></div>

## File system

[![windowsfundamentals1xbx](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals1xbx.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Modern versions of Windows use the New Technology File System (**NTFS**). Before, FAT16/32, and HPFS were used. FAT is still used for devices like USB keys. NTFS is a file system that can repair itself in the event of failure, using logs. It's known as a journaling file system.

**Case-insensitive and separator** üèùÔ∏è

Unlike Linux, for Windows, `a` and `A` are the same. And you can use `\ ` (the default separator), and `/` (Unix separator).

```ps
CMD> cd c:\Users\xxx
CMD> cd C:\Users\xxx
CMD> cd /Users/xxx
CMD> cd \Users\xxx
```

</div><div>

I'm using the below Unix paths because they're easier to write. Some paths may have changed, refer to environment variables.

* ü™µ **root**: `/`, which is usually `c:\ `
* üå≥ **Windows root**: usually `/Windows`
* üõù **user content**: Files belonging to a user
  * `/Users`
  * `/Users/xxx/Desktop` (ex: user `xxx`)
  * `/Users/xxx/Documents`  (ex: user `xxx`)
* üìÇ **Installed programs**
  * `"/Program Files/"`
  * `"/Program Files (x86)/"`
  * `%appdata%`: usually used to install apps without administrator privileges <small>(locally installed)</small>, or to store application data.
</div></div>

## Permissions, and users

[![windowsfundamentals1xbx](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals1xbx.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx)
[![windowsfundamentals2x0x](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals2x0x.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals2x0x)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

**Users** üßë

* `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`: a built-in account used by the system to do internal tasks. It has the highest level of permission.
* `LocalSystem`: another built-in account, but with less privilege than SYSTEM and still more than Administrator.
* `Administrator`: admin account to manage users, apps, groups, and system-wide settings...
* `Standard User`: can use apps, can access their files...

**Groups** (Security Groups) üë™

Administrators can set permissions for a group, and users may be in multiple groups.

**User Account Control (UAC)** (=sudo) ü´Ö

When there is a need for a user to elevate, Windows will show the User Account Control (UAC), in which a root user can press "yes", and a non-root user will have to log in using an account having sufficient privileges to do the requested action.
</div><div>

(NTFS) **Permissions** ([doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/bb727008(v=technet.10)#understanding-file-and-folder-permissions)) üîê

Windows has 7 categories of permissions for files on a filesystem: Read <small>(**R**)</small>, Write <small>(**W**)</small>, List Folder Contents <small>(**X**)</small>, Read & Execute <small>(**RX**)</small>, Modify <small>(**M**)</small>, Full Control <small>(**F**)</small> and Special permissions.

There are advanced permissions: Create Directory <small>(**AD**)</small>, Create File <small>(**WD**)</small>, Delete <small>(**D**)</small>, Execute/Traverse <small>(**X**)</small>, Change Permissions...

You can use the "security" tab from a file/folder properties or use th [icacls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/icacls) command to manipulate permissions. 

```ps
CMD> icacls xxx
xxx  NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
     BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
     Local\username:(I)(F)
CMD> icacls xxx /grant Everyone:F  # group
CMD> icacls xxx /grant username:F  # username
CMD> icacls xxx /remove username
```

Permissions are inherited <small>(**I**)</small> by children  while they may not <small>(**NP**)</small>. It's also possible to define if folders <small>(**CI**)</small> or files <small>(**OI**)</small> inherit ACE.
</div></div>

<hr class="sep-both">

## Environment variables

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

The syntax to display/use an environment variable is different.

```powershell
PS> ls Env: # list all
PS> echo $Env:systemroot # print one
PS> $Env:xxx = 'yyy' # set
```

These commands are only available in a CMD

```powershell
CMD> set # list all
CMD> echo %windir% # print one
```
</div><div>

Environment variables are

* `PATH`: same use as on Linux, but folders are separated with "`;`"
* `PATHEXT`: extensions that you may omit in commands
* `USERNAME`: current user
* `SystemDrive`: location to system drive
* `SystemRoot` / `windir`: location to Windows root
* `ProgramFiles`: location to program files
* `ProgramFiles(x86)`: location to program files
* `APPDATA`: location to app data
* `TEMP` / `TMP`: location to temp folder
</div></div>

## Windows tools

[![windowsfundamentals1xbx](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals1xbx.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx)
[![windowsfundamentals2x0x](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/thm/windowsfundamentals2x0x.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals2x0x)
[![windowsfundamentals](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/windowsfundamentals.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-fundamentals)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Windows tools can be opened using "execute" (Win  ‚ûï R) or in a CMD/PowerShell. Extensions that you may see, such as ".exe", or ".msc", are optional (see `PATHEXT`). Two well-known tools are:

**Task Manager** (`taskmgr`) üï∞Ô∏è

* Shortcut: <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+ESC</kbd>
* List of running processes
* This guide is quite complete [Windows Task Manager](https://www.howtogeek.com/405806/windows-task-manager-the-complete-guide/)

**Control panel** (`control.exe`) üßë‚Äçüç≥

* This is the entry point to most settings
* In the top-right corner, it's possible to switch to another view <small>(ex: small icons)</small>, in which you may discover menus that you (most likely) never opened before, but may be useful in one way or another.

**Computer Management** (`compmgmt.msc`) üëë

* A core tool to manage a computer
* Can be used to create/manage users/groups
* Can be used to manage disks, devices, network shares
* Can be used to manage running tasks, services, listing events ([doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-types), monitoring performance (`perfmon`/`resmon`), etc.

##### lusrmgr.msc

**Usage** üó∫Ô∏è: Manage local users and groups.

## Random Notes

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Shared Folders

[![windowsfundamentals](../../../cybersecurity/_badges/htb/windowsfundamentals.svg)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-fundamentals)

It's possible to share a folder over a network, allowing others on the network to access it. Right-click on a folder and open its properties, then navigate to the "Sharing" tab and share the folder.

In "Advanced Sharing," you can set the share name, the maximum number of simultaneous users, and set the share permissions.

Share permissions are only applied for remote users, along NTFS permissions. They are only three: Full Control, Change, Read.

üîí It uses the [CIFS](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/cifs.md) protocol.

‚û°Ô∏è Shares are mostly used with `Network Attached Storage (NAS)`, `Storage Area Network (SAN)`, or [Active Directory](/operating-systems/cloud/active-directory/_knowledge/index.md).
