## ‚ú® Terminology ‚ú®

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Domain Controller** (DC): servers from which you can manage the organisation using ADDS. For instance, the initial computer where Windows Server is installed is a Domain Controller.

**Domain**: for instance, `xxx.com`. You don't need to own it <small>(in a real-world install, you should)</small>. When users will connect to it, they will use `server/username`.

‚û°Ô∏è `server` is usually `xxx` in `xxx.com`.
