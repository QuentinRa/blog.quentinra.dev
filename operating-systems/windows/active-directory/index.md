# Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) is a tool to help sysadmin to manage organisation/schools/...

* üñ•Ô∏è Manage Computers, Servers, Printers
* üßë‚ÄçüçºÔ∏è Manage Users and Groups
* üößÔ∏è Manage Permissions to access files/apps/...
* ‚öñÔ∏èÔ∏è Manage Policies <small>(ex: password length/...)</small>
</div><div>

With ADDS, you log in once, from any machine, and got access to everything that you were giving access to

* üìÇ Your files/folders and shared files/folders
* üñ®Ô∏è Printers
* ‚úâÔ∏è Applications <small>(emails, vpn...)</small>
* ...

## ‚ú® Terminology ‚ú®

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Domain Controller** (DC): servers from which you can manage the organisation using ADDS. Any Windows server on which ADDS is installed is a Domain Controller.

**Domain**: for instance, `xxx.com`. You don't need to own it <small>(in a real-world install, you should)</small>. When users will log in to the server, they will use `server/username`.

‚û°Ô∏è The `server` usually is `xxx.com` or `xxx` (alias).

**Objects**: users, computers, printers, shared folders, groups, organization units...
</div><div>

**Security Groups**: they are used to group users, to apply permissions/GPO to everyone that is a member of this group. A user can be in multiple Groups.

**Organizational Units** (OUs): folders used to group object in a similar structure than the organization. You could have one OU per site <small>(ex: Laval, Montreal)</small> and for each site, one OU per service <small>(ex: Direction, Marketing, IT...)</small>. Like groups, you can apply permissions/GPO to an OU.

**Group Policy Objects (GPO)**: policies/rules that are applied on objects. We can use them to enable/disable some Windows features for some users, to configure user workstations...

* New > Group

To add members, either

* You can add groups in security filtering to only apply the GPO to some group inside the selected locations

You can also exclude users/objects in the tab "Delegation".
