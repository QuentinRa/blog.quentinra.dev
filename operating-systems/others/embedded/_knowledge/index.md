# Embedded devices And IoT

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Embedded devices are systems designed to perform specific functions within larger systems.

* üì¶ Compact size while not necessarily small 
* üè° Low power consumption
* üßì Longer lifespan that usual systems
* ü§ñ Constrained environment <small>(computer power, small memory, etc.)</small>

They are often connected to other devices and the internet forming a network called the **Internet of Things ü§ñ** <small>(IOT)</small>.
</div><div>

Many functions require them to exchange data or to remote control other devices. Some protocols were designed specifically for IoT.

## üëª To-do üëª

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

#### Physical device vulnerabilities

* poor manufacturing or design practices => audits
* lack of encryption => ...
* weak/default passwords => strong password policy
    * Ex: Mirai botnet
* outdated firmware => stays updated, secure boot
* Limit access to devices
* Device hardening

#### Protocols

* weak or non-existent encryption, authentication, or authorization
* Fiddler (tool)
* Limit access to devices
* CoAP, and MQTT
* Radio frequency (RF)
* Zigbee, Z-wave, and Bluetooth

#### External

* OWASP IoT Project
* IoT Village
</div><div>

#### Attacks

* Fuzzing: test crashes/... American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), Peach Fuzzer,  Spike Proxy, Sulley
* Network scanners: Angry IP Scanner
* Exploitation frameworks: CANVAS, CORE IMPACT
* Firmware: Firmware Mod Kit, Binwalk...
* ChipWhisperer, Glitch, or Shakti
* JTAG or UART
