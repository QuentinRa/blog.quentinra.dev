# VirtualBox

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

VirtualBox is a popular free virtualization software.

* [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

‚û°Ô∏è I strongly advise using version 7+, because, as far as I'm concerned, I have fewer problems in the newer version.

#### Random notes

‚û°Ô∏è If the VM crashes often, try reducing the size of the screen. It may be related to your computer overheating and closing it.

## Random notes

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Bug: no automatic mouse integration

By default, you can freely use your mouse between your host and your virtual machine. But, I have a bug ü™≤ when restarting a machine closed using "save instance state" in which my mouse is not detected anymore.

‚û°Ô∏è A "patch" is to lock your session before closing the VM.

#### Bug: bidirectional clipboard not working

‚û°Ô∏è Try restarting the VM.
