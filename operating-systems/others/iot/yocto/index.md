# Yocto for embedded systems

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Embedded systems have more limitations than usual workstations such as limited disk space or memory.

Because of that, there is a need to create small operating systems with as few packages as possible and properly configured for them to work within an environment with fewer resources.

To get started, install Poky. See also: [crops/poky](https://github.com/crops/poky-container).

```shell!
$ # assuming you got all deps installed
$ git clone -b <poky_version> git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
$ source poky/oe-init-build-env # load
```

[Petalinux](petalinux.md) is a build-system built on Yocto, and leveraging yocto components and tools for Xilinx platforms.
