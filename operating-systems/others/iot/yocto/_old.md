* Poky: the build system
* BitBake: executor and scheduler
* Metadata: definitions
  * .conf = variables, computer flags, paths...
  * .bbclass = build logic (ex: build a kernel, root fs...)
  * .bb = logic unit (ex: a library, packages)
* Steps during poky build
  * Download sources
  * Compile a list of what we need
  * Generate packages
  * Generate image (the base OS) + SDK (what you need for one application)

* Multiple meta folders = layers, they have a priority, can override settings from layers below

```bb
# xxx_version.bb
X = "value"
V = "${PV}" # version
DEPENDS += "yyy"

inherit autotools
inherit autotools xxx # gettext (localization)

yyy_[prepend|append|none]() {
  # ...
}
```

* Default is root with no password
* Source file (oe-init-build-env)
* `conf/` to edit local conf, and bbconf
