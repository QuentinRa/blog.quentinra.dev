# Azure SQL Database

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

[Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/doc-changes-updates-release-notes-whats-new?view=azuresql) is a database on a managed [SQL Server](/programming-languages/databases/relational/dbms/mssql.md). It's a SAAS solution handling maintenance, backups, scaling, etc. for us.

* **Account**: your account which may be managed by your organization (sync to AD). API Authentication is made using a JWT.

* **Subscriptions**: a subscription is associated with a product such as visual studio. The administrator can grant us access to a subscription and give us specific roles within it.

You can access the login portal at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).

üìö [Azure SQL Managed Instances](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview?view=azuresql) (MI) is a PAAS solution which can be used when we need to manage the SQL Server directly.

## Azure SQL Database Hardening üîíüõ°Ô∏è

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### ASD Hardening ‚Äî SQL Server Exposure

By default, the ASD is available via a public endpoint such as `your-server-name.database.windows.net`. It should be private <small>(e.g. VPN...)</small>.

```ps
$dump | Select-Object ServerName,PublicNetworkAccess
```

The ASD is behind a firewall to limit which IPs can access it. The default firewall allows every IP (`0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0`) and is too permissive.

```
$servers | ForEach-Object { Get-AzSqlServerFirewallRule -ServerName $_.sn -ResourceGroupName $_.rgn } | Where-Object StartIpAddress -eq "0.0.0.0" | ft
```

Microsoft Entry ID authentication allow you to easily manage access to the database while adding additional mechanisms such as MFA.

```ps
$servers | ForEach-Object { $res = Get-AzSqlServerActiveDirectoryAdministrator -ServerName $_.sn -ResourceGroupName $_.rgn; [PSCustomObject]@{ServerName=$_.sn; EntraStatus=if ($res) { "Enabled" } else { "Disabled" } } }
```

#### ASD Hardening ‚Äî Auditing And Logs

There is an "auditing" feature to monitor databases for security, compliance, and troubleshooting. You should enable it.

```ps
```

You will then have to configure the auditing policy <small>(3 values expected)</small>.

```ps
```

You should also ensure that log are not kept indefinitely <small>(<90)</small>. The default value is `0` for an indefinite period of time.

```ps
```

‚úçÔ∏è Make sure to monitor firewall changes and apply the least privilege principle. Try to be as granular as possible.

#### ASD Hardening ‚Äî Security Features

Enable Microsoft Defender for SQL and configure it.

```ps
```

Advanced Data Security (ADS) is a feature that enable data classification, vulnerability assessment, and the Advanced Threat Protection service. You should enable it.

```ps
$servers | ForEach-Object { Get-AzSqlServerAdvancedDataSecurityPolicy -ServerName $_.sn -ResourceGroupName $_.rgn }
```

Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) service monitors for suspicious activity <small>(faulty SQL, new SQL statement, new logins and logins brute force, etc.)</small>. You should enable it <small>(and all alerts should be enabled, which is the default)</small>.

```ps
# az sql server advanced-threat-protection-setting -g $_.rgn -n $_.sn
$servers | ForEach-Object { Get-AzSqlServerAdvancedThreatProtectionSetting -ServerName $_.sn -ResourceGroupName $_.rgn }
```
