<summary>Notes Kerberos</summary>

This is the authentication system in Windows domains, replacing NetNTLM. Users will log in to the Kerberos service and receive a ticket called **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**. They will use this ticket when requesting access to a share/database/... If the request is accepted, Kerberos will give them a **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)** allowing them to access the service. Then, they will use the TGS to log in to the service. No credentials are sent over the network.
