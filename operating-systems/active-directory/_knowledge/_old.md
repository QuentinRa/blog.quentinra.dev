**Security Groups**: they are used to group users, to apply permissions/GPO to everyone that is a member of this group. A user can be in multiple Groups.

‚û°Ô∏è Some existing groups: Domain Users, Authenticated Users...

**Organizational Units** (OUs): Like groups, you can apply permissions/GPO to an OU.

**Group Policy Objects (GPO)**: policies/rules that are applied on objects. We can use them to enable/disable some Windows features for some users, configure computers, enforce policies... 

‚û°Ô∏è More details in the [Permissions](#permissions) section.

‚û°Ô∏è Changes are distributed using a network share called SYSVOL (`C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\`). It may take time for the changes to be applied, but the update be forced with `gpupdate /force`.

* Go to profile
* You could select a local path, or mount a network drive, for instance, `\\ServerName\\SomeFolder\\%username%`.
* The drive will be shown next to the "C:" drive

‚û°Ô∏è The advantage of using `%username%` is that you can edit multiple users, and the value will be replaced for each one.

<details class="details-n">
<summary>Create Security groups</summary>

* Right-click on your domain
* New > Group

To add members, either 

* Right-click on the group, and select "Add to a group"
* Right-click on an object, select properties, go to "member of", and add your security group

<summary>Create Group Policy Objects</summary>

* Start the Server Manager
* Go to Tools > Group Policy Management
* Find the "Group Policy Object" folder
* Right-click on it > New and create a GPO

A GPO is applied to one or more OUs. It can be applied on the whole domain too. These are shown in "Scope > Location". 

* Drag-and-drop the GPO to the domain/an OU to add it inside location.
* You can add groups in security filtering to only apply the GPO to some group inside the selected locations

‚û°Ô∏è Policies are applied to OUs and nested OUs.

You can also exclude users/objects in the tab "Delegation".

* Click on "Advanced" and add an object to exclude
* Scroll down in the permission, and check "deny" for the line "Apply group policy"

Once created, you can edit the GPO to edit them.

</details>

<details class="details-n">
<summary>Automatically mount a shared folder as a drive (GPO)</summary>

By default, a user need to browse a path like `\\ServerName\Path\\To\Folder\` to access some shared folder on a server. It's possible to create a virtual drive that will point to a shared folder using GPO.

* Start the **Server Manager**

* Right-click on a GPO > Edit <small>(you could create a GPO and apply it on the whole domain, you can filter rules later...)</small>

<summary>Notes Kerberos</summary>

This is the authentication system in Windows domains, replacing NetNTLM. Users will log in to the Kerberos service and receive a ticket called **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**. They will use this ticket when requesting access to a share/database/... If the request is accepted, Kerberos will give them a **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)** allowing them to access the service. Then, they will use the TGS to log in to the service. No credentials are sent over the network.

<summary>Notes about trees and trust</summary>

Can create a sub-domain for another place with different policies/...
Subdomain, they inherit the schema. two-way implicit transitive (trust other subdomains) trust.
**Tree**. one way explicit trust (from B to A). Then B is able to use users from A, and give them permissions to access their tree.
