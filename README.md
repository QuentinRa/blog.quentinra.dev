``Memorize`` was made for students to gather knowledge and tutorials 
in one place, with exercises, that can help to understand and memorize
courses better.

Made by french people, typos are to be expected. And since we are students,
we can also make mistakes so be kind.

Course were made from teaching mostly learned at

* département informatique de l’IUT de Sénart-Fontainebleau à Fontainebleau
  (Seine-et-Marne, France)
* l’ENSIIE, école d’ingénieur en informatique à Évry
