I created my blog (formerly known as **Memorize**) to share notes, links, tutorials, experiences, along with exercises, to help others. If you are enjoying the website, **please star ‚≠ê the repository** to give me motivation.

Anyone can contribute, and you are more than welcome! There is a small gift for each contribution üòò!
