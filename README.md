## How to contribute

If you want to add a new course, add an entry in `.summary`, in the JSON of your course category.

```json
{
  "tag": "course-name",
  "name": "Name",
  "desc": "...",
  "icon": "null or a boostrap icon like <i class=\"bi bi-sim\"></i>"
}
```

If you choose `info`, then create in `/info/` a folder named `course-name`. Inside, create a file `index.md` that will be used as the entry point for your course. You may check others' files if you're wondering how you should write yours.

If you want to edit a course, simply edit the `.md` file.
