``Memorize`` was made for students to create courses to help 
others sail easier in the courses they struggled with.

Since we are still learning, we could have made mistakes 
so please kindly correct or report them. Thanks!

## How to contribute

If you want to add a new course, add an entry in
``.summary``, in the JSON of your category.

```json
{
  "tag": "course-name",
  "name": "Name",
  "desc": "...",
  "icon": "null or a boostrap icon like <i class=\"bi bi-sim\"></i>"
}
```

If you choose ``info``, then create in
``/info/`` folder named `course-name`. Then create
a file ``index.md`` that will be used as the entry
point for your course.

If you want to edit a course, simply edit the ``.md``
file. You may check the others files if you wondering
how you should do it.
