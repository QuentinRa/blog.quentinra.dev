## Security risks

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

**Sniffing**: without or with a weak encryption, an actor can listen to exchanged packets, to learn more about the network architecture, and to find the weak point.

**Spoofing**: an actor can usurp another machine identity to fake messages coming from the victim

**MITM**: xxx

**Tampering**: without integrity checks, an actor can tamper with messages without the sender/receiver being aware of it
</div><div>

**Firewalls**: it's important that the firewall has good access control rules and up-to-date.

**Logs**: centralized logs are good for users, but they must be secured to ensure that they are not tampered, and they must be closely monitored for the company to detect unusual activity as fast as possible.

**Password**: we must ensure that administrators/managers do not use weak/compromised passwords.
