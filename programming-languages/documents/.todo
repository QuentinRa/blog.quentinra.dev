## Installing sphinx

Sphinx is creating a website from your documentation. This is what Readthedocs will use. For python comments, you can skip this section.

* `pip install -U sphinx` (pip should be installed)
* `sphinx-build --version` (check your PATH)
* I'm using `make html` to compile in HTML on Windows from the cmd

Sphinx uses a tree-like system, we need to link the pages together. We do that with `toctree directive`

```rest
.. toctree::
 :maxdepth:

    Name printed     <file_rst_without_extension>
```
