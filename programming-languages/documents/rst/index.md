# reStructuredText

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

reStructuredText <small>(a.k.a. reST or RST)</small> is an enhanced markdown with additional syntax for complex documents.

It's mainly used in documentation as an alternative to Markdown. It's quite used with the documentation generator "sphinx" 🦁 and the well-known [readthedocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) 📚  theme.

What you can do in RST that you can't in Markdown:

* 👉 Write LaTeX <small>(math formulas...)</small>
* 👉 Generate UML diagrams <small>(plantuml)</small>
* 👉 Generate Plots <small>(graphviz)</small>
