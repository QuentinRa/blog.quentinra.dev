[webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) <small>(65.1k ‚≠ê)</small> is a popular tool to merge javascript code into a single file called bundle. It's not specific to JavaScript.

Refer to the [Official Documentation](https://webpack.js.org/) for details.

Webpack generates a file called **xxx.js.map** for debugging purposes during non-production builds. This file should not be uploaded in production as it contains code comments and commented out code.

```shell!
