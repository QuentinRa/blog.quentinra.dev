[webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) <small>(65.1k ‚≠ê)</small> is a popular tool to merge javascript code into a single "bundle" file often called `<scriptname>.js.map`.

* The `[.map]` file contains code comments and commented out code
* The `[.map]` file should not be exposed on production instances
* The bundled `[.js]` expose the `[.map]` filename with the comment `sourceMappingURL=` at the end of the file.

‚ö†Ô∏è Webpack optimize and minify the code. If it's not used, it's removed. Functions may be inlined if they are only used once.

To compile a bundle using webpack, you can use:

```ps
$ webpack --config webpack/webpack.prod.js
```

Refer to the [Official Documentation](https://webpack.js.org/) for details.

    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'assets/js/'),
    sourceMapFilename: '[file].map',
  },
