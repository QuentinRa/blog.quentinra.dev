# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Search Engine Optimization, commonly known as SEO, is a set of practices and strategies aimed at improving the visibility and ranking of a website in search engine results pages (SERPs).

SEO is an ongoing process as search engines continually update their algorithms. It means that the content below may be obsolete.

Search engines are using crawlers to index websites. They are basically bots inspecting each page and navigating on the website.

A few crawlers we can use to check a website:

* [siteliner](https://www.siteliner.com/) (250 pages max)
* [drlinkcheck](https://www.drlinkcheck.com/) (broken links)
* [snyk.io](https://snyk.io/website-scanner/) (vulnerabilities)

## Basic Practices

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-3"><div>

#### URL/robots.txt

‚û°Ô∏è Tell which files robots shouldn't access, and link your sitemap.

More at [robots-txt.com](http://robots-txt.com/). Test your [robots.txt using Google Search Console](http://robots-txt.com/ressources/robots-txt-tester/). You got [examples here](http://robots-txt.com/ressources/).

```yaml!
# allows everyone
User-agent: *
Disallow:

# Link to the sitemap (optional)
Sitemap: URL/sitemap.xml
```

<br>

#### Canonical URLs

It could be that two URLs are leading to the same page. For instance, `https://example.com` and `https://example.com/index.php`. You need to inform search engines, by setting the same canonical URL for both.

```php!
header("Link: <https://example.com/index.php>; rel=\"canonical\"");
```

```html!
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/index.php" />
```

<br>

#### Titles

* You must use exactly one header "h1"
* Title's length should be between 55-65 characters

```html!
<title>MainTopic - title1, title2, title3</title>
```

```html!
<title>MainTopic - title1, title2 | Organization</title>
```

</div><div>

#### Descriptions

You should write a good and unique description of your pages. The size displayed in the results is usually 110 characters (mobile), and around 130 on a computer.

<br>

#### URL/sitemap.xml

‚û°Ô∏è Ensure the search engine crawlers properly index your website. Provide additional information on resources such as videos/images... The format is an XML file, you can these to generate one on:

* <https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/> (max. 500 pages)
* <https://www.sitemapgenie.com/> (no limit, or it seems so)
* You can find some tools on GitHub

After creating a sitemap, you have to share it, as explained [here](https://ahrefs.com/blog/submit-website-to-search-engines/).

<details class="details-n">
<summary>Example</summary>

```xml!
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<urlset xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9
            https://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd">
    <url>
        <loc>https://blog.quentinra.dev/</loc>
        <lastmod>2021-08-27T18:11:59+02:00</lastmod>
        <priority>1.00</priority>
    </url>
</urlset>
```
</details>

<br>

#### Structured Data

I'm unsure if this helps with SEO, but it allows search engines, if they want to, to display rich results. For instance, when we type a name, we often see the Wikipedia page on the right.

* [Test your structured data (Google)](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data)
* [structured-data.org](http://www.structured-data.org/)
* [json-ld.org](https://json-ld.org/)
* [php-json-ld](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/php-json-ld)


You can look for websites to generate structural data, to learn the syntax, [such as this one](https://attrock.com/schema-markup-generator/). Note that you may need to escape the "\\".

<details class="details-n">
<summary>Example</summary>

```html!
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
    "@context": "https:\/\/schema.org",
    "@type": "Article",
    "mainEntityOfPage": {
        "@type": "WebPage",
        "@id": "https:\/\/example.com\/"
    },
    "headline": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "author": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "XXX",
        "url": "https:\/\/example.com\/"
    },
    "publisher": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "XXX",
        "logo": {
            "@type": "ImageObject",
            "url": "https:\/\/example.com\/assets\/icon64.png",
            "width": "32",
            "height": "32"
        }
    }
}
</script>
```
</details>

## Performance Optimization

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Content delivery network (CDN)

Resources are cached on nearby servers to reduce the loading time of static resources <small>(CSS, images, videos, audios...)</small>.

* [jsdeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) <small>(free, works with [GitHub](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo/path/to/file.png))</small>
* [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) <small>(free, but not decentralized)</small>
* [gitcdn](https://github.com/schme16/gitcdn.xyz) <small>(same as jsdeliver, but slower)</small>
* [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) <small>(üëª)</small>
* [keycdn.com](https://www.keycdn.com/) <small>(üëª)</small>
* [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/) <small>(üëª)</small>
</div><div>

#### Images

Clients must download every image, and it slows page loading.

* Compress images
* Use `.webp` instead of `.jpg`/`.png`
* See [imagekit](https://imagekit.io/) (üëª)
* Cache images ([see article](https://web.dev/http-cache/))

<br>

#### Tools

* [pagespeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) (test page loading time)
