# Web development

Web development is usually divided between two sides:

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

üë≤ **Front-end** üë≤

What is displayed to the user.

* HTML, CSS, JS
* Bootstrap, tailwindcss...
* Vue.js, React, Angular, Ionic
* ...
</div><div>

üåç **Back-end** üåç

The servers, the databases, and basically everything else.

* PHP, Django, Symfony, Laravel...
* SQL, NoSQL
* Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js...
* ...
</div></div>

There is also üëë **Full-Stack** üëë which is both the front-end and the back-end, along Mobiles <small>(React Native...)</small> and Desktops <small>(Electron...)</small>.

## Get started

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Browsers are using the [HTTP](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/http.md) protocol to communicate with a webserver. The server is supposed to return an **HTML page**.

* üëâ If there are no routing, the URL is associated with a local path on the server, and the file is loaded if present.

* üëâ If there is no file in the URL, webservers may load `index.html`/`index.php`/... if present.

* üëâ Modern apps are usually using a router. This reduces securities issues. Every URL will be redirected to one file, and this file will determine which HTML page should be returned.
</div><div>

**What do you need?**

To develop simple HTML websites, you don't need anything, you can use the `file://` protocol <small>(drag and drop the HTML in your browser)</small>.

For more complex apps <small>(PHP, HTTPS...)</small>, you must install a webserver such as Apache, Nginx, Node, IIS...

‚û°Ô∏è To upload things on a remote server, see the [FTP protocol](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/ftp.md).

## Webserver configuration notes

üòµ *Due to some mistake on my side, these notes were not tested (nor complete) at all* üòµ

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Change the password of the user provided by the hosting provider.

```powershell
$ sudo passwd xxx
```

Upgrade packages.

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

Disable `ssh` login for root/..., and change the default port.

```powershell
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Install a firewall.

```powershell
$ sudo apt install fail2ban
$ sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
$ sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```
</div><div>

Add a non-root user.

```powershell
$ sudo adduser yyy
```

Permissions for files/folders.

```powershell
# ‚û°Ô∏è If you're using public_html
$ chmod 711 ~
$ chmod 711 ~/public_html
# ‚û°Ô∏è The least permissions
$ chmod 700 file.php # for a .php
$ chmod 744 file.html # for a .html
$ chmod 711 folder # for a folder
```
</div></div>

<hr class="sep-both">

## HTTPS, and TLS/SSL

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

You can get free certificates using [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). If you want to have **https**://localhost, [follow this tutorial](https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/).

To install a certificate from Let's encrypt, we mainly use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

```powershell
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install snapd
$ sudo snap install core
$ sudo snap refresh core
$ sudo snap install --classic certbot
$ sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```
</div><div>

Ex: To generate one certificate for two domains, on an apache server.

```powershell
$ sudo certbot --apache --cert-name xxx.com -d xxx.com -d www.xxx.com
$ sudo certbot --apache -d xxx.com -d www.xxx.com
```

‚û°Ô∏è You can add as many domains as you want with `-d`.

For automatic renewal

```powershell
$ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```
</div></div>

## üòç Developer tools (devtools) üòç

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The devtools are tools for developer. You can open it using

* <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>Left-click > Inspect</kbd> ‚ú®
* <kbd>Settings > ... tools > development tools</kbd> üòÖ

The 4 most used tools are

* **Tools > elements** <span class="small">(<kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+I</kbd>)</span>: see/edit the HTML/CSS
* **Tools > <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-in-up-left"></i>** <span class="small">(<kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+C</kbd>)</span>: select a element and see the correspond HTML code in the Element tab.
* **Tools > <i class="bi bi-window"></i>** <span class="small">(<kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+M</kbd>)</span>: preview the website on a phone...
* **Tools > Console**: execute some JavaScript, try: `41+1`
</div><div>

There are a lot more tools. If some are not available for you, you may have to enabled them <small>(see "+" in Edge, see "... > more tools" in Chrome...)</small>.

* **Tools > Sources** üïµÔ∏è: see the code source of the page
* **Tools > Application** ü™Ñ: see the local storage, the cookies, etc.
* **Tools > Problems** üßü: you can see problems using webhint
* **Tools > LightHouse** ü•á: you can see the evaluation of a page by LightHouse (Google)

‚û°Ô∏è There is also a color picker, allowing you to find which color was used somewhere on a website.

## üëª To-do üëª

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Apps**

* progressive web apps (PWA)

A URL is a suite of: a scheme (http/https), a username, a password, `@`, a domain, `:`, a port, a route, a query (`?`), and a fragment (`#`). Most parameters are optional, the URLs you will use will mostly look like this

```
URL
* Scheme: (protocol) HTTP/HTTPS/...
* Username:Password@Domain:port/Path?query#Fragment_or_Hash
http://example.com
http://example.com:80
https://example.com
https://example.com:443
https://example.com/route/?query#fragment
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1:80
[...]

<details class="details-n">
<summary>captcha</summary>

In some cases, you should use a captcha ("**I'm not a robot**"). Someone may write a script trying to brute-force your login form. You can add a captcha and check on your server that the captcha got submitted before processing the login form.

The most-well know solution is **ReCaptcha** (v2 / v3), proposed by Google. In v3, you won't have to process a captcha, but Google will watch what you are doing (mouse, ...), and may request you to submit a captcha if your (human) score is too low. Check their [tutorial here](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro).

You may consider [hcaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) as an **alternative to ReCaptcha**. But it had quite a lot of criticism for being hard to solve (<s>or maybe they were Google employees ü§£</s>). From my point of view, it is indeed sometimes hard to solve, and even TryHackMe, the ones that made me discover hcaptcha, moved to ReCaptcha (v2), but I don't know if this is related.

Adding a captcha should not be an easy choice. It may not be a good idea.

* You can start first by limiting the number of requests per IP and hour/...
* You can add a captcha if a user failed to log in once

What you need to remember is that, **if almost every person filling your captcha are human**, then you should **really consider an alternative**, to improve their **user experience (UX)**. On top of that, bots can also bypass a captcha <small>(at least it seems so, but I didn't try)</small>.

<hr class="sl">

## For ReCaptchaV2, my notes

* (v2) put an HTML tag looking like that `<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey=""></div>`
* (v2) in your PHP

```php
$post_data = array('secret' => 'your-secret-key', 'response' => 'data-site-key');
// send post request (look for code/library on the WEB)
// ...
// to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify
// and check the result
```

To put words to it, Google will add a key to the form, which needs to be verified using their API (PHP). You need to provide your secret key and the submitted key, and you will get to know if it's valid or not.
