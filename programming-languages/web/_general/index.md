# Web development

Web development is usually divided between two sides:

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

👲 **Front-end** 👲

This is what is displayed to the user.

* HTML, CSS, JS
* Bootstrap, tailwindcss...
* Vue.js, React, Angular, Ionic
* ...
</div><div>

🌍 **Back-end** 🌍

The servers, the databases, and everything else.

* PHP, Django, Symfony, Laravel...
* SQL, NoSQL
* Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js...
* ...
</div></div>

There is also 👑 **Full-Stack** 👑 which is both the front-end and the back-end, along Mobiles <small>(React Native...)</small> and Desktops <small>(Electron...)</small>.

## Get Started

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Client

A client is a browser that will be used to access a website. Most of the front-end languages can be used without a server:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

Simply drag-and-drop your HTML file inside your browser. Notice that the protocol is `file://` instead of `http://` or `https://`.

#### Server

Most apps use a client-server approach. A client will request pages of a website <small>(HTML, CSS, JS...)</small> to a webserver that can use a server-side technology to generate them.

It means that we need to set up a web server:

* We often use [Apache](/operating-systems/cloud/webservers/apache/index.md) or nginx for PHP apps.
* [Node.js](/programming-languages/web/node.js/_general/index.md) apps are usually creating a server  from the code.
