# Python

Python 🐍 is a multi-purpose high-level scripting language. Because it's quite easy to learn/use, it's unfortunately used as a [Golden hammer](https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/golden-hammer) 🔨🔥 <small>(AntiPattern)</small> by many developers.

You can use **Python interpreter**:

```ps
$ python3
>>> "Hello, World"
'Hello, World'
>>> quit()
```
</div><div>

Otherwise, you can also create a file `xxx.py`:

```ps
# print "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!");
```

Then use:

```ps
$ python3 xxx.py
Hello, World
```
</div></div>
