OCaml find to do a lot of things involving libraries. One usage could be to compile using `ocamlc` files that use external libraries.

```bash
# create a file "test"
# while compiling with debug information (-g)
# avg.ml and test.ml
# while linking external libraries: extlib and oUnit
#
# Read the documentation if you want to learn more about -package or -linkpkg, while -g/-o are options of ocamlc
ocamlfind ocamlc -o test -package extlib,oUnit -linkpkg -g avl.ml test.ml
```

## Functional languages

You must declare a variable with `let`. **You can't modify a variable, you will have to create a new one** (concept of **immutability** âœ¨).

```ocaml
let x = 5
x = 6 (* NOT POSSIBLE *)
let x = 6 (* delete the old x, create a new one *)
```

In functional languages, there should be no side effects. Hence, **if you are not storing something in a variable**, **the compiler will ignore it**, something like "If I don't see you use it later, then it means that you don't need it" (concept of **purity** âœ¨). In other words, a function returning "void" such as a print is impure. Fortunately, variables starting with a `_` are not stored by the compiler, so you can use this when calling an impure function.

```ocaml
Printf.printf "%s\n" "Hello, World" (* IGNORED !!! *)

(* all of them are equivalent *)
let _ = Printf.printf "%s\n" "Hello, World"
let _ = Format.printf "%s\n" "Hello, World" (* Printf.printf is "weird", use Format *)
let _ = Format.printf "%s@." "Hello, World" (* do this one *)

(* In OCaml, "1+2" without parenthesis is considered as given 3 parameters '1' '+' '2' to a function, so add parenthesis *)
let _ = Format.printf "%d@." (1+2)
(* same for "-1" *)
let _ = Format.printf "%d@." (-1)
```

To be accurate, in OCaml **everything is a value**, so you can give "`-`" (minus) to a function, as for OCaml "`-`" is a function taking two integers and returning one integer. A function taking another function in argument is called a **higher-order function** âœ¨ (`fonction d'ordre supÃ©rieur`).

<summary>Summary of functional paradigm</summary>

* **Immutability**: you can modify a variable
* **Referential transparency**: if `f(x)=y`,
  writing `y` or `f(x)` must be the same. 
* **Purity**: `f(x)-f(x)` is equals to 0, there is no side effects, and you can predict the outcome of your code
* **Implicit types**: types are implicit
* **First-class citizens**: a function can be given as parameter to another function called higher-order function (`Fonction d'ordre supÃ©rieur`)

## Meaningless knowledge

<details class="details-e mt-4">
<summary>Comments</summary>

In OCaml, comments are not ignored, and they are really parsed... If you are writing a `"` (quote), the parser will think that you started writing a string, even if you are inside a comment. Hence, if the string is not properly finished (no matching quote), you will have an error, as you would if you wrote a non-terminated string in your code.

It can lead to surprising comments âœŒ, this one bellow (try it), is a valid comment, but most ocaml highlighters such as the one I'm using, are not parsing it properly.

```ocaml
(* "this is a string *)" *)
```

Also, in OCaml, you can have a comment inside another comment. What I mean, is that you can have a closing comment tag inside another comment... In every other language, you will see an error because the comment would be "(* (* *)", but in OCaml, the code below is working fine

```ocaml
(* (* *) *)
```
