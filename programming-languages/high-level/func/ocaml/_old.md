## Data structures

We are testing different ways of storing big amounts of data, along with their efficiency.

## Meaningless knowledge

<summary>Comments</summary>

In OCaml, comments are not ignored, and they are really parsed... If you are writing a `"` (quote), the parser will think that you started writing a string, even if you are inside a comment. Hence, if the string is not properly finished (no matching quote), you will have an error, as you would if you wrote a non-terminated string in your code.

It can lead to surprising comments âœŒ, this one bellow (try it), is a valid comment, but most ocaml highlighters such as the one I'm using, are not parsing it properly.

```ocaml
(* "this is a string *)" *)
```

Also, in OCaml, you can have a comment inside another comment. What I mean, is that you can have a closing comment tag inside another comment... In every other language, you will see an error because the comment would be "(* (* *)", but in OCaml, the code below is working fine

```ocaml
(* (* *) *)
```
