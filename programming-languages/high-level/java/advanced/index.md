## Input/output streams

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Files, and sockets <small>(networking)</small> are two examples of streams. We read in `InputStream` üìñ, and write in an `OutputStream` ‚úçÔ∏è. There is also:

```java!
System.in           // standard input stream
System.out          // standard output stream
System.err          // error output stream
```

‚ò†Ô∏è With in input/output stream, we can only read/write integers:

```java
// import java.io.IOException;
// import java.io.InputStream;
// import java.io.OutputStream;
InputStream reader = System.in;   // example
OutputStream writer = System.out; // example
int read = reader.read();         // read one
writer.write(5);                  // write one
```
</div><div>

So, we usually wrap them within a **buffer**.

```
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));   // example
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out)); // example
String s = reader.readLine();     // read a line
writer.write("....");             // write a line
writer.newLine();                 // write a \n or \r\n
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Reading/writing may fail. You need to [try-catch]() every `IOException`. Whether you have one or multiple `try-catch` is up to your needs.

#### Streams of bytes

Streams of bytes are not using BufferedReader/Writer.

```java
BufferedInputStream reader = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(file));
BufferedOutputStream writer = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(file));
```

## Threads

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Threads allow us to run tasks in parallel üî•. We will create a `Runnable` with the code executed by the thread.

```java
// version 1
Runnable r = () -> {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
};
// version 2
class CodeRunByTheThread implements Runnable {
	@Override
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
Runnable r = new CodeRunByTheThread();
```

To create and execute a thread:

```java
Thread thread = new Thread(r);
thread.start();
```

üëâ Use `Thread.sleep(duration);` to wait for a duration.
</div><div>

When multiple threads try to access a variable, there may be concurrency problems üí•. You can prevent them by only allowing one thread at a time to call a method using `synchronized`:

```java
[...]
    public synchronized void myMethod() { [...] }
[...]
```

Otherwise, you can use a `mutex` and `synchronized` to only allow the one that could lock the mutex to run some code:

```java
private Object lock = new Object();

public void myMethod() {
    synchronized (lock) { /* ... */ }
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you're using threads to update a variable, you need to mark it as `volatile`, to ensure other threads will notice the variable changed.
