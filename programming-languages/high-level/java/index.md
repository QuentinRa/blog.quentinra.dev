# Java

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Java is a well-known object-oriented programming language. It's maintained and owned by Oracle üçµ.

Java was designed as a cross-platform language. We write code once, and on any operating system, we would have the same output. This is done by executing the code on a virtual machine called **JVM**.

‚û°Ô∏è The current version is **Java 20** (2023). The [LTS](_files/download.md#lts-jdk) is **Java 17**.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World");
  }
}
```
</div><div>

Java files have the extension `.java`. To compile it, you need a **JDK** <small>(Java development kit)</small>. The output is a `.class`. [Download JDK](_files/download.md).

```shell!
$ javac HelloWorld.java # output: HelloWorld.class
```

To execute your compiled program, you need a **JRE** <small>(Java runtime environment)</small>. It's included in the JDK.

```shell!
$ java HelloWorld
Hello, World!
```
