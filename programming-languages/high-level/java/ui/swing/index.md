# Swing/AWT

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Swing and AWT are libraries bundled with Java to create graphical interfaces. Swing was introduced as a replacement to AWT, but it didn't completely replace AWT.

☠️ Modern developers prefer to use [JavaFX](../javafx/index.md), which heavily cut down the quantity of code, and the time invested for the same output.

These are the two base packages:

```java!
import java.awt.*;    // awt
import javax.swing.*; // swing
```

👉 Swing classes usually start with `J` followed by their AWT name.
