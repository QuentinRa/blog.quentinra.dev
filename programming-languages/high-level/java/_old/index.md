* [Exceptions](beginner/exceptions.md)
* [Overload](beginner/overload.md) (Surcharge in French)
* [Inheritance](beginner/inheritance.md)
* [Override](beginner/override.md)
* [Abstract classes](beginner/abstract.md)
* [Interfaces](beginner/interfaces.md)

If we summarize abstract class and interfaces

| | abstract | Interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constructors | Can have constructors, but you can't write `new AbstractClass()` | Can't have constructors. |
| Attributes | It's like in a normal class. | Only public class constants. |
| methods (instance) | It's like in a normal class, but some methods can be abstract. | abstract or concrete (JDK8) methods, public only <small>(private allowed since JDK9)</small>. |
| methods (class) | concrete, all visibilities modifiers. | concrete, public only <small>(private allowed since JDK9)</small>. |

**Practice**

* check you remember and understand the [theory](beginner/mcq.md)
* but you must write some code! (again ðŸ™„)
