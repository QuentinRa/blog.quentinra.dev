# Non-relational databases

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Non-relational databases**, a.k.a. **NoSQL** (**NotOnlySQL**), are databases using a different approach to data storage and manipulation compared to [relational databases](/programming-languages/databases/relational/_knowledge/index.md) ✨.

Here are some majors NoSQL databases models/stores:

* **Key-value** 🔑: a key-value system
* **Document** 📂: data stored as documents
* **Columnar** 🗄️: using a key-column <small>(values)</small> system
* **Graph** 🕸️: nodes and edges

👉 NoSQL means that SQL databases are not the only databases.

Each NoSQL database model has its pro and cons, but overall, NoSQL databases pro and cons are:

* 🌱 They were designed to handle large amounts of data <small>(scalable)</small>
* ✍️ They are flexible <small>(no schema, semi- or completely unstructured)</small>
* 🔥 Data may be duplicated or inconsistent <small>(quantity over quality)</small>
* 🚀 They have high performances <small>(required by low-latency apps)</small>
* 📒 They have limited query features <small>(relatively to SQL/...)</small>

NoSQL databases became quite popular around 2010, and they are used by a lot of actors like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or Twitter.
