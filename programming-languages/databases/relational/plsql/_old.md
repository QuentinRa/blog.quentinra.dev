# Procedural Language

PL/SQL (Oracle) - particularities

```sql
-- show more information about your errors (need to be called multiples times)
show errors;
-- raise an exception
exception_name EXCEPTION;
PRAGMA exception_init(exception_name, code);
raise_application_error(code, "message");
```

<details>
<summary>Procedures ðŸ™„</summary>

This is a sort of function, with some small differences (no return, parameters OUT, cannot be called in SQL, ...).

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE
procedure_name(name1 type, name2 type) IS
-- variables
BEGIN
-- code
END;
/ -- compile

-- call (one of these)
execute procedure_name(args);
call procedure_name(args);
```
</details>

## Statements

<details class="details-e">
<summary>IF and CASE (switch)</summary>

```sql
IF something THEN [ELSIF another_condition THEN]
	[ELSE THEN]
END IF;

-- IF ELSEIF ... ELSE
CASE variable
	WHEN value1 THEN instructions
	WHEN value2 THEN instructions
	ELSE instructions
END CASE;
```

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Loop (do while) and while</summary>

```sql

END LOOP;

-- while
WHILE something LOOP some_code END LOOP;

</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>For statement</summary>

```sql

## Triggers

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mx-0"><div>

A trigger (`dÃ©clencheur`) is a function that will be triggered on an event, such as inserting, updating, or deleting an element. You could use it to calculate derived fields, or to archive deleted records.

```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE /* or AFTER */ some_event ON some_table
[FOR EACH ROW]
[WHEN some_condition]
-- some code (ex: BEGIN ... END)
-- or
-- EXECUTE PROCEDURE function(args);
```
</div><div class="align-self-center">

A trigger is executed either **BEFORE** or **AFTER** an event, such as **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ...**. You may set a trigger only on **one column** using `UPDATE(column)` or `UPDATE OF column`.

Add **OR REPLACE** if you are updating an existing trigger.

* **FOR EACH ROW**: If you are planning to update every row, then add it. This may be the case, if the grade of each person is based on the median. If a grade changes, we need to update every grade.

* **WHEN**: You may add a when clause. If the condition is false, then the trigger is not triggered for this record.

> **Pro tip**: you can make a trigger for multiples events, with `OR` such as `INSERT OR UPDATE`.<br>
</div></div>

A function called by a trigger isn't a normal function. Aside from the two variables **NEW** and **OLD**, **you will have to return** (type = TRIGGER)

* `NULL`: cancel insert/update/delete
* `NEW`/`OLD`/...: the new record
* If you omit RETURN, then it's the same as `RETURN NEW`

**Vocabulary** ðŸ˜Ž

* **Trigger DML**: executed on every record that triggered the event
* **Trigger DML line**: executed once per event
* **Trigger DDL** (`Trigger base/schÃ©ma`): executed once

> **Pro tip**: no COMMIT/ROLLBACK in a trigger, as the request will already do once.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>OLD and NEW âœ¨</summary>

When updating a line, you got the old record in `OLD`, the one after updating in `NEW`. For INSERT, you got only `NEW` (OLD is null). For DELETE, you got only `OLD` (NEW is null).

You will most likely use them inside your trigger âœ¨. They are called **correlation variables**. They are records, such use `.` to get an attribute.

Sometimes, we are renaming them. Right before the `FOR EACH ROW` (even if you don't have one), you could do this, to use `:old` and `:new`.

```sql
REFERENCING OLD :old NEW :new
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Delete a trigger</summary>

```sql
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name ON some_table;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name ON some_table;
```

## Some templates

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Function</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function(param1 INTEGER, param2 INTEGER) RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'param1 is %. param2 is %.', param1, param2;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Then test

```sql
SELECT some_function(5,10);
-- [...] param1 is 5. param2 is 10.
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Catch an exception</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function() RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    Select 1/0;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN division_by_zero then RAISE EXCEPTION 'catch';
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Select into</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function() RETURNS RECORD AS $$
DECLARE
    v_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    Select 1, 'Luna', 18, 'Woman' INTO v_record;
    RETURN v_record;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Then test

```sql
SELECT some_function()
-- (1,Luna,18,Woman)
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Using a cursor</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function() RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
v_cursor CURSOR IS SELECT 'Luna' as NAME; -- some real request ðŸ™„
BEGIN
    FOR v_entry IN v_cursor LOOP
        -- do something
        -- raise exception :)
        RAISE '%', v_entry.name;
	END LOOP;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

```sql
SELECT some_function();
-- [...] Luna
```
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Triggers</summary>

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION some_function() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN NEW; -- 
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

You should check if "BEFORE INSERT" is what you want, and if you should remove "FOR EACH ROW"...

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER some_trigger BEFORE INSERT ON some_table FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE some_function();
```
