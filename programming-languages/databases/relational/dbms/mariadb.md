MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system. It was created by the developers of [MySQL](mysql.md) after concerns arose about the acquisition of MySQL by Oracle Corporation.

It is designed to be compatible with [MySQL](mysql.md), so everything possible in MySQL is possible in MariaDB.
