Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It's often used by developers when building .NET applications. 

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is a graphical client that can be installed along MSSQL or separately. . It allows database administrators, developers, and other users to perform various tasks related to SQL Server databases.

üê≤ MSSQL default port is 1433.

Common commands:

## MSSQL vulnerabilities ‚ò†Ô∏è

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

* On Linux, you can use [mssqlclient](/operating-systems/networking/protocols/tools/impacket.md#mssqlclient)

```shell!
$ impacket-mssqlclient username@IP -windows-auth
$ impacket-mssqlclient username:password@IP -windows-auth
```

The `-windows-auth` option is optional because the administrator might have set up a separate account to access the database, aiming to limit lateral movement.

* You can also use some [Metasploit](/cybersecurity/red-team/tools/frameworks/metasploit/index.md) modules.

```shell!
$ msfconsole -q
mfs6> search mssql/             # Find useful modules
mfs6> use mssql_enum_sql_logins # Random example
mfs6> set RHOSTS <IP>
mfs6> set USERNAME <username>
mfs6> set PASSWORD <password>
mfs6> set USE_WINDOWS_AUTHENT true
mfs6> run
```

Random Notes

* If installed, look for saved credentials in SSMS

* The services often runs as `NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER`

* By default, encryption is not enforced when attempting to connect.
