# Mobile development 

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Mobile development refers to developing applications that run on mobiles. They can be **native** or **hybrid**/**cross-platform**.

ü§ñ Native applications are written in the operating system <small>(ex: Android)</small> language <small>(ex: Kotlin)</small>. They are optimized for the operating system and enable developers to create feature-rich applications.

üåç Hybrid or cross-platform applications can be written in many languages such as [JavaScript](/programming-languages/web/javascript/_general/index.md) <small>(React Native, Flutter)</small>... Such applications are usually easier to develop, but they may be less performant or not cover some needed platform-specific functionalities.
