# Mobile development 

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Mobile development refers to developing applications that run on mobiles. They can be **native** or **hybrid**/**cross-platform**.

ü§ñ Native applications are written in the operating system <small>(ex: Android)</small> language <small>(ex: Kotlin)</small>. They are optimized for the operating system and enable developers to create feature-rich applications.

üåç Hybrid or cross-platform applications can be written in many languages such as [JavaScript](/programming-languages/web/javascript/_general/index.md) <small>(React Native, Flutter)</small>... Such applications are usually easier to develop, but they may be less performant or not cover some needed platform-specific functionalities.

Android and iOS native mobile development involves different tools and languages. A short summary:

|            | Android           | iOS                  |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Language   | Kotlin \| Java    | Swift \| Objective-C |
| IDE        | Android Studio    | XCode                |
| Networking | Retrofit          | Alamofire            |
| Store      | Google Play Store | Apple App Store      |
