## Layout Editor

Instead of editing the XML manually, you will usually use the Design mode.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mx-0"><div class="align-self-center">

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><b>Mode</b>: you can switch to the XML/Layout editor here</li>
<li><b>Palette</b>: views that you can drag and drop to the design view</li>
<li><b>Design view</b>: what the user will see</li>
<li><b>BluePrint view</b>: Design View, but with hidden elements too</li>
<li><b>Component tree</b>: list of all views of your screen</li>
<li><b>Attributes</b>: edit the properties of a view</li>

</ol>
</div><div>

**TIP**: you should rely on <kbd>CTRL+F</kbd> to search for attributes, or by clicking on the search icon at the top of the "Attributes" window.

**TIP**: you will most likely have a time when you want to replace a view with another view. In the component tree, right-click on a view, and use "convert view". You could also manually get the job done by directly editing the `.xml`.

## üëª To-do üëª

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Android Studio <small>(Google)</small> is the most used IDE. It's based on IntelliJ Community <small>(JetBrains)</small> üòé‚ù§Ô∏è. There are a few life-saving shortcuts

* <kbd>CTRL+P</kbd>: in `method(<here>)`, show the arguments of a method
* <kbd>CTRL+SPACE</kbd>: manually trigger autocompletion <small>(then use <kbd>TAB</kbd>)</small>
* <kbd>SHIFT+SHIFT</kbd>: search for a method/class/setting...
* <kbd>ALT+ENTER</kbd>/**hover something** highlighted in red, yellow, gray... to see quick fixes/details.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Configure in-editor documentation</summary>

To see the documentation of a method, use <kbd>CTRL+Q</kbd> or hover a method. By default, you won't see anything interesting.

* Navigate to the source of any Android class. As a reminder, you can use <kbd>CTRL+(MOUSE LEFT)</kbd> like in VSCode/...
* Click on "Download sources"
* Done
</details>

*You should refer to IntelliJ notes if you want to master Android Studio.*

#### Gradle

In the Project tab, at the bottom, you got a section "Gradle Scripts". You will have to edit the second `build.gradle (Module: XXX)`.

<div class="text-center">

![gradle](_images/gradle.png)
</div>

Inside `dependencies {}`, you will add new libraries. You need to click on "sync" (when prompted) each time you add a new dependency.

<br>

#### app/manifests/AndroidManifest.xml

This is a file that describes

* What is the main activity <small>(~=screen)</small>?
* What activities <small>(~=screens)</small> you defined?
* What are the permissions that your application needs?
* If your application defining services <small>(~=tasks)</small>?
* ...

<br>

#### app/java/com.xxx.yyy

This is where your classes will be stored.
</div><div>

#### app/res

This is where the resources of your application will be stored.

* Drawables <small>(images, icons...)</small>
* Layouts <small>(the layout of each screen)</small>
* Menu
* Values <small>(translations, colors/themes...)</small>
* XML <small>(preferences...)</small>

<br>

#### Device Emulator

The device emulator allows you to create a virtual device or connect yours. You may (or most likely will) use

<div class="row mx-0"><div class="col-9">

* **Device File Explorer**: device's file system
* **Layout Inspector**: running app layout
* **App inspection**: to see workers/tasks/...
* **Logcat**: to see logged messages

**Note**: you may have to refresh the virtual file system manually if you don't see recent changes.

**Note (2)**: on virtual devices, use "..." to manually change settings (location...).
