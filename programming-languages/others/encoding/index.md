# Encoding

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Encoding üñºÔ∏èÔ∏è is a way of presenting data. Unlike encryption üîí, anyone that can identify the algorithm used can decode the message.

A radix or a base is a number of unique digits that we can use to encode a message. The most well-known ones are

* binary <small>(radix 2, $[0-1]$)</small>
* octal <small>(radix 8, $[0-7]$)</small>
* decimal <small>(radix 10, $[0-9]$)</small>
* hexadecimal <small>(radix 16, $[0-9]$ and $[A-F]$)</small>
* base32 <small>($[A-Z]$ and $[2-7]$ or $[A-V]$ and $[0-9]$)</small>
* base64 <small>($[A-Z]$ and  $[0-9]$ and $[+/]$ and "=" for padding)</small>

‚û°Ô∏è "Radix n" or "Radix-n" are both valid and commonly used.

**Some common rules** üìå

* In a $radix\ n$, values goes from $0$ to $n-1$
* After 9, we are using letters
* After 35, we are using symbols
* ...
* $(n)_{k}$ means that the number $n$ is in a radix $k$

## Division by base

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The division by base is a simple and straightforward way to convert number from any base to any base.

* $a = \text{your_number}$
* $n = \text{your_radix}$
* do while $a > 0$
    * $q_i = \frac{a}{n}$
    * $r_i = a\ mod\ n$
    * $a = q_i$

The output is a set of $r_i$. You may have to convert them. For instance, $15$ will be converted to $F$. The final value is the concatenation of every $r_i$ **in the reverse order** (from the last to the first).

‚û°Ô∏è There are other techniques such as
</div><div>

**Example** üî•

* $a = 6072$
* $n = 15$
* do while $a > 0$
    * $q_0 = 6072 / 15 = 404$
    * $r_0 = 6072\ mod\ 15 = 12$
    * $q_1 = 404 / 15 = 26$
    * $r_1 = 404\ mod\ 15 = 14$
    * $q_2 = 26 / 15 = 1$
    * $r_2 = 26\ mod\ 15 = 11$
    * $q_3 = 1 / 15 = 0$
    * $r_3 = 1\ mod\ 15 = 1$
    * exit, $a$ is now 0

Then we are converting $12=C$, $14=E$, $11=B$, and concatenating them in reverse order giving us $(6072)\_{10} = (1BEC)\_{15}$.

## Radix 2 - üñ•Ô∏è

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Radix 2, commonly called binary, is a base made of one and zero. It's the language used by machines üñ•Ô∏è.

To convert a binary to decimal, and vice-versa, you need to know every power of two ($2^9 = 512 \ldots$).

| $2^8$ | $2^7$ | $2^6$ | $2^5$ | $2^4$ | $2^3$ | $2^2$ | $2^1$ | $2^0$ |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 256   | 128   | 64    | 32    | 16    | 8     | 4     | 2     | 1     |


**Every number can be expressed as a sum of powers of two.** If you used a power of two when expressing a number, then add a 0, else 1.

#### Radix 10 to Radix 2

* $125 = 64+32+16+8+4+1$
* $125 = 2^6+2^5+2^4+2^3+2^2+2^0$
* $125 = {\color{red} 1 *} 2^6+ {\color{red} 1 *} 2^5+ {\color{red} 1 *} 2^4+ {\color{red} 1 *} 2^3+ {\color{red} 1 *} 2^2 + {\color{green} 0 *} * 2^1 + {\color{red} 1 *}2^0$
* $(125)\_{10} = ({\color{red} 11111} {\color{green}0} {\color{red}1})\_{2}$

#### From Radix 2 to Radix 10

* $(1111101)\_{2}$
* There are 7 digits, so the first is $2^6$
* $1 * 2^6 + 0 * 2^5 + 1 * 2^4+ 1 * 2^3+ 1 * 2^2+ 0 * 2^1+ 1 * 2^0$
* $64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1$
* $125$

## Radix 8 - üíÄ

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Radix 8, commonly called octal, is a base made of numbers from zero to seven. It's not commonly used  üíÄ.

Radix 8 numbers may, or may not, start with a `0` (0), such as `07`. The zero indicates that this is an octal number.

**3 binary digits are equals to one octal number.**

#### From Radix 8 to Radix 2

* Given $(175)\_{8}$
  * $(1)_8 = ({\color{grey}00}1)_2$
  * $(7)_8 = (111)_2$
  * $(5)_8 = (101)_2$
* Giving us $(175)\_{8}=({\color{grey}00}1111101)\_{2}=(1111101)\_{2}$
</div><div>

#### Radix 2 to Radix 8

* Given $(1111101)\_{2}$, we need 2 leading zeros
* $(001111101)\_{2}$
* Now, simply convert each group of 3 digits to radix 10 üî¶
  * $(001)\_2$ is equals to $0+0+1=(1)_{10}$
  * $(111)\_2$ is equals to $4+2+1=(7)_{10}$
  * $(101)\_2$ is equals to $4+0+1=(5)_{10}$
* So we have $(1111101)\_{2}=(175)_{8}=0175$

‚û°Ô∏è We convert to radix 10, but it's a same as converting to radix 8, as the maximum value is 7. I said "radix 10" to avoid a recursive problem.

## Base64 - ‚úâÔ∏è

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div class="align-self-center">

Base64 is usually used to encode an image/..., so that we can transfer it as a string. Most base64 strings are ending with "=", or "==", which is the padding.
