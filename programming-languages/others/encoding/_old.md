## Radix-8

A radix-8 number is called an octal number, and it's made of values from $0$, and $7$. In most languages, an octal number is starting with $0$.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**From radix-8 to radix-2** [online tool](https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/octal-to-binary-converter)

A digit in radix-2 is equals to 3 digits in radix-8 <small>($2^3=8$)</small>. You will use that to convert each radix-8 digit to a 3-digits binary, and convert back each 3-digits binary, to a radix-8 digit.

* Given $(175)\_{8}$
  * $(1)_8 = (1)_2$
  * $(7)_8 = (111)_2$
  * $(5)_8 = (101)_2$
* Giving us $(175)\_{8}=(1111101)\_{2}$

Your number of digits in base-2 should be a multiple of 3 to apply the previous formula, if not, add leading zeros.

* Given $(1111101)\_{2}$, we need 2 leading zeros
* $(001111101)\_{2}$
* Now, simply convert each group of 3 digits to radix-8, as you would for radix-10
  * $001$ is $1$
  * $111$ is $1+2+4=7$
  * $101$ is $1+4=5$
* So we have $(175)_{8}$ or $0175$

## Radix-16

A radix-16 number is called a hexadecimal number, and it's made of values from $0$ to $9$, and letters from $A$ to $F$. In most languages, an octal number is starting with $\text{0x}$.

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**From radix-16 to radix-2** [online tool](https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-binary-converter)

A digit in radix-2 is equals to 4 digits in radix-8 <small>($2^4=16$)</small>. You will use that to convert each radix-16 digit to a 4-digits binary, and convert back each 4-digits binary, to a radix-16 digit.


| 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   |

* Given $(7D)_{16}$
  * $(7)_{16} = (111)_2$
  * $(D)\_{16} = (13)\_{10} = (1101)_2$
* Giving us $(7D)\_{16}=(1111101)\_{2}$

Your number of digits in base-2 should be a multiple of 4 to apply the previous formula, if not, add leading zeros.

* Given $(1111101)\_{2}$, we need 1 leading zeros
* $(01111101)\_{2}$
* Now, simply convert each group of 4 digits to radix-16, as you would for radix-10
  * $0111$ is $1+2+4=7$
  * $1101$ is $1+4+8=13$, but $13$ do not exist in radix-16, so we should use $D$
* So we have $(7D)_{16}$ or $\text{0x}7D$

## Radix conversion without passing by radix-2

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Every previous example was first converting radix-10 to radix-2, then radix-2 to radix-n. This is both inefficient, and not universal, as the same process can't be applied to radix-15, which isn't a multiple of 2...

Instead, here is another more universal, though possibly harder/longer

* $a = \text{your_number}$
* $n = \text{your_radix}$
* do while $a > 0$
  * $q_i = \frac{a}{n}$
  * $r_i = a\ mod\ n$
  * $a = q_i$

Using this algorithm, in the end, you have to convert every invalid $r_i$ to radix-n <small>(ex: 14 in radix-15 is E)</small>, and concatenate **in the reverse order** every value. You can [use rapid-table website to do it online](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/base-converter.html).
</div><div>

* $a = 6072$
* $n = 15$
* do while $a > 0$
  * $q_0 = 6072 / 15 = 404$
  * $r_0 = 6072\ mod\ 15 = 12$
  * $q_1 = 404 / 15 = 26$
  * $r_1 = 404\ mod\ 15 = 14$
  * $q_2 = 26 / 15 = 1$
  * $r_2 = 26\ mod\ 15 = 11$
  * $q_3 = 1 / 15 = 0$
  * $r_3 = 1\ mod\ 15 = 1$
  * exit, $a$ is now 0

Then we are converting $12=C$, $14=E$, $11=B$, then concatenating in reverse order giving us $(6072)\_{10} = (1BEC)\_{15}$.
