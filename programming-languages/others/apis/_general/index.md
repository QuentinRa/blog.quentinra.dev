# Application Programming Interfaces

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are used to create a layer of abstraction called "interface" between clients and services.

A few services commonly interfaced by APIs:

* 🪺 a database
* 💵 a bank payment service
* 💬 a social media platform
* 🗺️ a geolocation and mapping service
* ...

An API can interface both internal and external services, e.g. developed by the company or another company.

For the client of the API

* 😎 Simplify the integration of a service
* 💐 Standardized way to interact with a service
* 🍹 The service is maintained by the provider <small>(less work to do)</small>

For the provider of the API

* ✨ Can be used by websites, mobile apps, etc.
* 🍹 Centralize <small>(mostly database)</small> accesses <small>(ex: easier to find+patch bugs)</small>
* 💎 Can aggregate multiple data sources <small>(i.g. multiple databases...)</small>
