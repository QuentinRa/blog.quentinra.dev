# GraphQL

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

[GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL) (Graph Query Language) is an open-source query language for APIs. It's used by GitHub, Shopify, and Facebook internally.

* [GraphQL Documentation](https://graphql.org/) <small>(‚õ™)</small>
* [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) <small>(19.8k ‚≠ê)</small>

It was designed to provide a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. It solves a problem of REST APIs which is under- and over-fetching.

Look into the JavaScript Source Code and you may find if it's used.

There is only one endpoint. We can perform multiple queries in one request. To query the `id,username` of the `user` with `id=123`:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 123) {
    id
    username
  }
}
```

Look for: `/api/graphql`, `/graphql`, `/graphiql`, etc.

## Introspection üó∫Ô∏è

Introspection refer to dumping the API schema. It's often disabled in production.

#### Introspection ‚Äî Manual Queries

Each object has a type. Each type has attributes. The type may have a constructor with arguments that are required to query an object.

```text!
{__schema{types{name}}}
{__schema{types{name,fields{name}}}}
{__schema{types{name,fields{name},description}}}
{__schema{types{name,fields{name,args{name,description,type{name,kind,ofType{name, kind}}}}}}}
```

After identifying the types and their arguments, we can query them:

```text!
{MyType{field1, field2}}
{MyType(arg:value){field1, field2}}
```

‚û°Ô∏è When errors are enabled, you can receive suggestions from GraphQL like a type or attribute name that is similar to your input.

#### Introspection ‚Äî Graphical WebUI

[GraphQL Voyager](https://graphql-kit.com/graphql-voyager/) <small>(7.7k ‚≠ê)</small> can take the input from your introspection query or from tools such as [clairvoyance](#introspection--clairvoyance) and display it as a graph.

#### Introspection ‚Äî clairvoyance

[clairvoyance](https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance) <small>(1.0k ‚≠ê)</small> can be used to dump the schema:

```shell!
$ pipx install git+https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance
$ clairvoyance 'https://example.com/api/graphql' -o schema.json
```
