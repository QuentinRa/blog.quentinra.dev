It was designed to provide a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs.

To query the `id,username` of the `user` with `id=123`:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: 123) {
    id
    username
  }
}
```

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Each object has a type. Each type has attributes. The type may have a constructor with arguments that are required to query an object.

```text!
{__schema{types{name}}}
{__schema{types{name,fields{name}}}}
{__schema{types{name,fields{name},description}}}
{__schema{types{name,fields{name,args{name,description,type{name,kind,ofType{name, kind}}}}}}}
```

After identifying the types and their arguments, we can query them:

```text!
{MyType{field1, field2}}
{MyType(arg:value){field1, field2}}
```
