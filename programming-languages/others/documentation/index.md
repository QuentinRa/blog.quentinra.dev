# Code Documentation

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Developers usually redact some documentation along the code to document some knowledge related to their code, such as:

* ‚úçÔ∏è how, and when the code can be used
* üìù how the code is expected to behave
* ‚è≥ how the code was designed/implementation notes
* ...

There are plenty language-specific documentation tools such as [Javadoc](/programming-languages/high-level/java/javadoc/index.md) for [Java](/programming-languages/high-level/java/_general/index.md), [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html) for [JavaScript](/programming-languages/web/javascript/_general/index.md), or [phpDoc](https://phpdoc.org/) for [PHP](/programming-languages/web/php/_general/index.md)...

There is also [Doxygen]() which works with many languages.

Mostly for software or user-documentation, you can [documentation generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_documentation_generators) <small>(static documentation site generators)</small>. 

* [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
* Sphinx and [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
* [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/)

They are separate from the code ‚ö†Ô∏è.
