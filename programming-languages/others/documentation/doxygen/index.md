Doxygen is a widely used documentation generator tool, especially for C/C++ projects. It generates documentation from specially formatted comments within the source code ✨.

To get started, generate doxygen configuration file.

```ps
$ doxygen -g Doxyfile  # generate
$ less Doxyfile        # look at the contents 
                       # "more" on Windows
```

To build the documentation, use:

```ps
$ doxygen Doxyfile
```

Open the `index.html` file in your browser <small>(ex: double-click on it)</small>.
