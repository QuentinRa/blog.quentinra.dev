# Doxygen

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Doxygen is a widely used documentation generator tool, especially for C/C++ projects. It generates documentation from specially formatted comments within the source code ‚ú®.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) <small>(4.9k ‚≠ê)</small>
* [Manual](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html) <small>(‚õ™)</small>
* [Quick reference](https://www.mitk.org/images/1/1c/BugSquashingSeminars$2013-07-17-DoxyReference.pdf) <small>(unofficial, üíé)</small>

You can download doxygen from the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/releases). You can also download the manual as a PDF from there üìö.

‚û°Ô∏è Doxygen folder on Windows: `C:\Program Files\doxygen\bin`.

To get started, generate doxygen configuration file.

```ps
$ doxygen -g Doxyfile  # generate
$ less Doxyfile        # to look at the contents 
                       # use "more" on Windows
```

To build the documentation, use:

```ps
$ doxygen Doxyfile
```

Open the `index.html` file in your browser <small>(ex: double-click on it)</small>.

## Doxyfile

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

The Doxyfile allows you to define doxygen settings. You can edit it manually, or you can use `doxywizard`.

```ps
$ doxywizard Doxyfile
```

The only setting that is required to set is **INPUT**. You will most likely set **EXTRACT_ALL** and maybe **GENERATE_TREEVIEW** too.


#### Project metadata

* `PROJECT_NAME = "..."`: project name
* `PROJECT_NUMBER = "..."`: a version such as `0.0.5`
* `PROJECT_BRIEF = "desc"`: project description
* `PROJECT_LOGO = "path"`: project logo

#### HTML settings

* `USE_MATHJAX = TRUE`: enable mathjax.js (for LaTeX)
* `GENERATE_TREEVIEW = YES`: add a navigation panel
* `LAYOUT_FILE = "path"`: a layout to change documentation layout
* `HTML_HEADER = ./header.html`: add your own `header.html`

* `HTML_EXTRA_FILES = file.js`: load a JS file

#### Input/Output settings

Input

* `INPUT = path` and `INPUT += path`: you need to add your source folders here for their documentation to be generated.
* `RECURSIVE = YES`: recursively browser input folders
* `EXTRACT_ALL = YES`: add to the website entries with no documentation <small>(yet?)</small>

Output

* `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "path"`: generate website folder
* `OUTPUT_LANGUAGE = "English"`: documentation language

Others

* `EXCLUDE = path` and `EXCLUDE += path`: exclude some path
