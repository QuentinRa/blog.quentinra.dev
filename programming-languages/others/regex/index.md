# Regular expressions (regex)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Regular expressions** (`expressions régulières`), commonly referred to as **regex**, are an enhanced version of [glob-patterns](/operating-systems/linux/knowledge/index.md#glob-patterns) and present in most, if not all languages.

🎯 Everything learned in glob-patterns is still available in regexes, so it won't be covered. ⚠️ The symbol for "one character" is now `.` <small>(dot)</small> and not `?` <small>(question mark)</small> which was given a new meaning.
