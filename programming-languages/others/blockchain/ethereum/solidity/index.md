[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) is a high-level [object-oriented](/programming-languages/_paradigm/oo.md) language used to implement smart contracts, most notably on the Ethereum blockchain.

A **smart contract** 📝 is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into code.
