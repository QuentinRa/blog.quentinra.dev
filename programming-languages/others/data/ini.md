# INI files

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div class="align-self-center">

The **INI** file format was originally only used by Windows to store initialization data and configurations. It's now used by many applications even on Linux, such as `php`.

This is a plain text file with **a key associated with a value**.

> On Linux, the equivalent is a `.conf` file.
