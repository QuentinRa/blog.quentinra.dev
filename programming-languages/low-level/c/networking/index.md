# Networking in C

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

Networking in C is done by creating sockets, which are either:

* 🌊 **STREAM sockets**: refer to the TCP protocol
* 🌾 **DATAGRAM sockets**: refer to the UDP protocol
* 🦆 **UNIX sockets**: refer to the Unix domain protocol

You also need to define an applicative protocol for each app:

* 📃 What's the format of data exchanged? <small>(endianness, types...)</small>
* ✈️️ What's the common flow for messages? <small>(ex: TCP SYN-ACK...)</small>
* 🥀 How are error handled?
* ...
