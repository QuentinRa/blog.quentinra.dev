<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Assembly languages are low-level languages directly interacting with a processor such as an Intel or an ARM processor.

X86 assembly is one of the assembly languages used for CISC processors <small>(Complex Instruction Set Computing)</small> such as Intel processors.

* 🧐 Rich instruction set compared to RISC processors
* 🧩️ Versatile and capable of handling a wide range of tasks
* 💻 Commonly used in desktop and server environments
* 🚨 May consume more power while power-efficient options exist

X86 transitioned from 32-bit to 64-bit architecture with x86-64.
