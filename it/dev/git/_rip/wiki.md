# Wiki

[Go back](../index.md#advanced-concepts)

> A wiki is a group of pages written in Markdown. You will usually write the documentation of your project inside.

That's a good practice to create one, but you may use an external documentation instead. Here is a link to [the official tutorial by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/).

You can add images in a wiki using one of those two ways

* drag and drop an image into a temporary issue, then copy the generated link
* copy an image into your project then use a path
  * if it does not work, try adding a leading `/`
  * if this still isn't working, git clone the **wiki**, and add the image inside the folder, commit, push, then try again (ðŸ˜‘)
