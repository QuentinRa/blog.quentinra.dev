# Version-control using Git

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

When working on a project, here are a few problems

* **code sharing** 📬: the need to allow other developers/contributors to read, or even edit the code
* **a need for time travel** 🗃️: the developer removed some old long time ago, and now needs to access it again. There could also be a case in which there is a need to go back to a previous version
* **duplicates** 🎭: a copy of a project to test something
* **computer dies** 😵: if your computer dies, and you don't have backups, then you lost your project for good
</div><div>

Version-control is helpful to solve these, and Git is the most well-known one. To use Git, there are two actors involved

* **clients** 👲: these are computers that will download project, work on them, upload their changes...
  * The command `git` / [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/) (Windows) 
  * [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  * [Git extension (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview) (👻)
  * [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) (👻)
  * JetBrains integrated Git client <br><span>&nbsp;</span>

* **servers** 🖥️: they will host the code, and make it available to those allowed, or public if you're working open-source.
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/) (Microsoft, my favorite)
  * [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) (Well-known alternative to GitHub)
  * [Gogs](https://gogs.io/) (open-source, self-hosted)
  * [Gitea](https://gitea.com/) (👻)
  * [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (👻)
