There are many tools out there providing features for open-source project, such as watching dependencies to detect vulnerabilities, find vulnerabilities/code smells/... in the code...

**Code quality, coverage, and reviews**

* [sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io) (quite a lot of feedback)
* [codefactor](https://www.codefactor.io/) (good)
* [deepsource](https://deepsource.io/) (not very deep)
* lgtm.com (deprecated, see [code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning))
* [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) (👻)
* [codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) (👻)
* [scrutinizer-ci](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/) (👻)
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) (👻)
* [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/) (👻)
* [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) (👻)

**Automatic deployment**

* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) / [Heroku (student)](https://www.heroku.com/students) (👻)
* [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com/) (👻)
* [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) (👻)

**Random**

* [weblate](https://weblate.org/) (👻, paid, continuous localization)
* [snyk](https://snyk.io/) (security, good)

**Language-specific**

* [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) (👻, style for PHP/CSS/JS)
* [packagist](https://packagist.org/) (👻, PHP packages)
* [deps.rs](https://deps.rs/) (👻, Rust dependencies alerts)
* [DavidDM](https://david-dm.org/) (👻, Node.js dependencies)
* [PackageQuality](https://packagequality.com/) (👻, npm packages)
