There are many tools out there providing features for open-source project, such as watching dependencies to detect vulnerabilities, find vulnerabilities/code smells/... in the code...

**Code quality and reviews**

* [sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io) (quite a lot of feedback)
* [codefactor](https://www.codefactor.io/) (good)
* [deepsource](https://deepsource.io/) (not very deep)
* lgtm.com (deprecated, see [code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning))
* [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) (👻)

**Others**

* [weblate](https://weblate.org/) (👻, paid, continuous localization)
* [snyk](https://snyk.io/) (security, good)

**Language-specific**

* [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) (style for PHP/CSS/JS)
