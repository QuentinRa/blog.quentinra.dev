Render Mode (light) => auto/important/not pixel/vertex

Terrain => https://unity3d.college/2017/07/17/importing-real-world-terrain-unity-free-terrain-party/

Button => navigation "automatic" => visualize
=> "HoldToClick" (button that we need to keep pressed => filling) =>
    => IPointerUpHandler
    => IPointerDownHandler

Image => type "Filled" => fill amount => slide it to see a button filling itself

Drag things => IDragHandler (set position with eventData)
    => IBeginHandler
    => IEndDragHandler
    => IPointerEnterHandler

If you got some UI on top of something, and you are checking for mouse events,
you can use EventSystem.current.IsMouseOverGameObject()

Cursor => texture type => cursor
    => SetCursor OnMouseEnter/Exit

OnEnable/OnDisable => save

Raycast => sight
    => Debug.DrawRay(origin, direction * depth, color)
    => new Ray(origin, direction) or use position, direction instead of ray
    => Physics.Raycast(ray, out RaycastHit hit)
    => Physics.Raycast(ray, distance, layerMask)
    => Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit, distance)
    => RaycastAll
    => ScreenPointToRay

Animation => Set Layer default

Create empty with renderer and nest model

Relationship
=> famous reference (drag and drop) for one or a list/array

NavMeshAgent
=> SetDestination to move

Unity "as" to cast

Static variable => onEnable/onDisable that are adding themselves in the list
