# Distribution properties

[Go back](..#joint-probability)

First, you should remember that a distribution must follow these criteria to be valid

* the sum of all probabilities is **1**
* all values are in $[0,1]$

## Independence

The independence between two distributions is defined the same as the independence between two variables. For instance for discrete variables, we have

* $\mathbb{P}(X=x,\ Y=y) = \mathbb{P}(X=x) * \mathbb{P}(Y=y)$
* $\mathbb{P}(X=x|Y=y) = \mathbb{P}(X=x)$
* $\mathbb{P}(Y=y|X=x) = \mathbb{P}(Y=y)$
