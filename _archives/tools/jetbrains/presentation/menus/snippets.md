# Snippets

[Go back](../menus.md)

You can create customs snippets. For instance, when you're typing `for`, JetBrains is showing you some pre-written code: that's a snippet.

* Open `Settings > Editor > Live template`.
* Create a new `live template`.
* write a name, for example `for`
* write a description, shown when suggesting snippets
* write some code if this snippet is selected

You can create variables using `$name$` then go to `edit variables` and tune how this variable should act.
