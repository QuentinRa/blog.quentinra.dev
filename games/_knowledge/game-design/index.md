# Game Design

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Game design is the process of creating and developing the rules, mechanics, and overall structure of a video game.

Games designers are redacting a **Game design document** (GDD) that covers every information and aspect of the game.

* [1-Page Game Design Document](https://vitalzigns.itch.io/gdd)
* [Game Design Document (GDD) Template](https://vitalzigns.itch.io/gdd)
* [Game Design Document Template](https://retrocademedia.itch.io/gddtemplate)

‚úçÔ∏è Do not remove entries from your game design document. Simply strikethrough them, to ensure we keep track of the changes.

#### Metadata

* **Name**, **Genre** (RPG üöÄ, FPS, ...)
* **Short description**
* **Target audience**: age, country, language, new players/experienced, platforms

#### Overview

* What's the goal? What's the **plus-value** of your game?
* Why should we play your game?
    * Is it the Hero? It is the story?
    * What feelings are you expecting the player to feel?
* What makes the game fun to play?

‚ö†Ô∏è You are NOT the player. Ask for feedback a lot of times.

#### Game Story

* What's the world of your game? (open-world?)
* What's the story?
* What's the goal of your Hero?
    * Short-term
    * Mid-term
    * Long-term
* What are the obstacles to the goal?
  * Traps
  * Enemies
* Can the player die? How would he get a "Game over"? Are there "save points"?
* What kind of graphics are you planning to use? Something realist, or more something fantasist?

üìö Take inspiration from other successful games.

#### Game Mechanics

[Mechanics](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamemechanic) are the rules of your game. Basically, what the player can do, and what the player can't do.

* Can the Hero, Jump? Walk? Run? Open a door/chest/...?
* What are the items? (perks, loot, usage)
* Is there a looting system? How does it work?
* How are money, player life, time, etc. handled?
* Is the user influencing the world? <small>(ex: The Witcher 3)</small>
* What are the maps? Draw or list each map.
  * Shops
  * Houses
  * Cities
  * ...

You would also have to define the stats of the player

* Is there HP, MP, ATK, ...?
* Is there a notion of stamina?
* Is there an inventory? what's its size? etc.

For instance, if you are making a zombie game, you may add a stat "infected" turning the player into a zombie if the stat reaches 100.

#### User Interfaces

* What's shown on the screen?
    * Is there a mini-map?
    * Are there some skills shortcuts?
    * Is there a life/mana/stamina bar?
    * Is there an icon for the settings? the sound?
    * Are there icons for other players?
    * Is there a chat?
* What are the screens of your game? <small>(draw a mockup)</small>
    * Inventory?
    * Play/Pause/Game Over/...
* Is there an animation when switching screens? Describe...

* Reaching 100% of completion <small>(e.g., all quests, etc.)</small>
* Add Multiplayer Content
