Game design is the process of creating and developing the rules, mechanics, and overall structure of a video game.

Games designers are redacting a **Game design document** (GDD) that covers every information and aspect of the game.

✍️ Do not remove entries from your game design document. Simply strikethrough them, to ensure we keep track of the changes.
