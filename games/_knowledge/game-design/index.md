# Game Design

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Game design is the process of creating and developing the rules, mechanics, and overall structure of a video game.

Games designers are redacting a **Game design document** (GDD) that covers every information and aspect of the game.

* [1-Page Game Design Document](https://vitalzigns.itch.io/1-page-gdd)
* [Game Design Document (GDD) Template](https://vitalzigns.itch.io/gdd)
* [Game Design Document Template](https://retrocademedia.itch.io/gddtemplate)
* [Game Design Document Template](https://toddmitchell.itch.io/game-design-document)

✍️ Do not remove entries from your game design document. Simply strikethrough them, to ensure we keep track of the changes.

## Game Planning

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Metadata

* **Name**, **Genre** (RPG 🚀, FPS, ...)
* **Short description**
* **Target audience**: age, country, language, new players/experienced, platforms

#### Overview

* What's the goal? What's the **plus-value** of your game?
* Why should we play your game?
    * Is it the Hero? It is the story?
    * What feelings are you expecting the player to feel?
* What's making the game fun to play?

⚠️ You are NOT the player. Ask for feedback a lot of times.

#### Game Story

* What's the world of your game? (open-world?)
* What's the story?
* What's the goal of your Hero?
    * Short-term
    * Mid-term
    * Long-term
* What are the obstacles to the goal?
  * Traps
  * Enemies
* Can the player die? How would he get a "Game over"? Is there "save points"?
* What kind of graphics are you planning to use? Something realist, or more something fantasist?

📚 Take inspiration from other successful games.
