# 1. Planning

> **Tip**: don't put things under the carpet, "that will be easy" or "...", because most, if not all the time, things aren't easy. That's also why you should start with nearly any content, and add things little by little.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Game Mechanics</summary>

These are the rules of your game. Basically, what the player can do, and what the player can't do.

* Can the Hero, Jump? Walk? Run? Open a door/chest/...?
* What are the items? (perks, loot, usage)
* Is there a looting system? How does it work?
* How are money, player life, time, etc. handled?
* Is the user influencing the world? (ex: `The Witcher 3`, ...)
* What are the places of your game? Give pics/a list of places such as
  * Shops
  * Houses
  * Cities
  * ...

You would also have to define the stats of the player

* is there HP, MP, ATK, ...?
* is there stamina?
* is there an inventory? what's its size? etc.

Things about this carefully, for instance, if you are making a zombie game, you may add a stat "infected" turning the player in a zombie if the stat reached 100 (`game over?`).
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Game design</summary>

* What's shown on the screen?
  * Is there a mini-map?
  * Is there some skills shortcuts?
  * Is there a life/mana/stamina bar?
  * Is there an icon for the settings? the sound?
  * Is there icons for other players?
  * Is there a chat?
* What are the screens of your game? <small>(you may make a mockup of each screen)</small>
  * Inventory?
  * Play/Pause/Game Over/...
* Is there an animation when switching screens? Describe...
</details>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Technical specifications</summary>

* How is the user interacting with the game
  * F12: Full Screen?
  * Escape: Settings? Pause?
  * Z: forward, ...
  * ...
* Do the user need a keyboard? a mouse?
* Is a joystick supported?
* How can the user become strong? (combos/...)
* What kind of playstyle should be encouraged? discouraged? (ex: bashing/farming?)
  * are the mobs/monsters respawning? (if not, you could prevent the user from farming)
  * you can prevent the user from accessing some quests/areas

In most games, we are not telling every combo at the start, because it would be too much. As the user is progressing, he/she is learning more combos/things.

## 2. Development

### 2.1. Tools for your game

Starting a game from scratch is really fun üòé‚ú®, you will learn a lot of things about what game engines are actually doing for you. But, it's costing a **lot of time**, and aside from learning something, you are simply trying to reinvent the wheel üé°, which I not a good idea.

* you should pick a **game engine** (ex: `Unity`, `Unreal engine`, etc.)
* or you should pick a **library** (ex: `LibGDX`, etc.)

It may be weird too, but you may also use **templates** in a game engine. Because a lot of developers are working on the same game engine, you could expect that some developers would build a sort of game engine, inside a game engine, but targeting one game, or one kind of game. [You can learn more about this, in this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG0GVLYzkus). My recommendation is [More Mountains assets](https://moremountains.com/unity-assets).

### 2.2. Tools for coding

You could use **VSCode**, or Jetbrains IDEs <small>(**CLion** for C++, **Rider** for C#)</small> if you are a student, or you got some money ü§ë.

### 2.3. Other tips

* Always define who should do what (good planning)
* Do not stay too much time on details/not quite relevant things (on small games)

<hr class="sl">

## 3. Production/Release

Make the game ready to be released.

* Steam? ...
* Credits
* Beta/Way of reporting bugs (and patching them?)

You should also test your game, while telling the testers what kind of feedback you are interested in.

<hr class="sr">

## Replay value

The **replay value** or **replayability** is a score of how much more content the user could discover after completing the game once.

* Alternate/different scenario
* New challenges (new places, new classes, open-world, new difficulties, new play styles)
* Completing the game (i.g. without missing one-time events/items, etc.)
* Multiplayer
* Achievements

## Game assets

Links to find your assets (backgrounds, sprites, music, sounds, SFX, ...) for your game.

**Best marketplaces**

* **My favorite is**: [itch.io](https://itch.io/)
* You got quite a long [list of websites here](https://hotpot.ai/free-game-assets) ([GitHub](https://github.com/HotpotDesign/Game-Assets-And-Resources))
* A [GitHub repository with another long list](https://github.com/Kavex/GameDev-Resources)
* If you are on unity, [you got the Unity Assets Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) üôÑ

## Data

* [Donjon.bin.sh](https://donjon.bin.sh/) (generate data for RPG)
* [boardgamizer](http://www.boardgamizer.com/) ("Board Game Design Idea Generator")

## Sprites

* [RpgMaker kind of characters - generator](https://junkhunt.net/vx/charachip.shtml) (generate 2D characters in many directions+faces, using RPGMaker character generator, online, free, in Japanese)
* [Game Character Hub](https://www.gamecharacterhub.com/) (generate 2D characters in many directions+faces, using RPGMaker character generator, paid?)
* If you are using PVGames sprites, you can use [Nightmare_82 tool](https://gitlab.com/Nightmare_82/charactercreator/) to generate faces, sprites in a lot of versions (jump, walk, sleeping, etc.), and in 8 directions.

> Generate some avatars with [joeschmoe](https://joeschmoe.io/). You can check [humaaans](https://humaaans.com/) or [ira](https://iradesign.io/) too. I doubt you will use any of these in a game, but maybe somewhere else?
