# Developing Video Games

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Video games are complex and involves multiple disciplines.

* Game Design ✍️ <small>(mechanics, rules, story, etc.)</small>
* Level Design 🗺️ <small>(layouts, areas, interactions, etc.)</small>
* Art and Animation 🖼️ <small>(textures, models, animations, etc.)</small>
* Sound and Musics 🎺 <small>(musics, sounds, effects, etc.)</small>
* User Interface 🕹️ <small>(menus, overlays, etc.)</small>
* Programming 🤖 <small>(game engines, scripts, templates, etc.)</small>

There are many tools and online resources that leverage the process of making a game, allowing independent developers to publish their games. They mostly use the [itch.io](https://itch.io/) platform.

Many projects are cancelled, especially games. 

* 🕹️ Always have a working version for others to test it
* 🗺️ Do the minimum first, don't try to do everything at once
* ✍️ It's often not possible to release a bug-free game. Sometimes, it's better to release something to get some feedback.

Game development is structured in at least 4 phases:

* Planning
* Development
* Testing
* Release
