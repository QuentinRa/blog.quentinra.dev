# Developing Video Games

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Video games are complex and involves multiple disciplines.

* Game Design ✍️ <small>(mechanics, rules, story, etc.)</small>
* Level Design 🗺️ <small>(layouts, areas, interactions, etc.)</small>
* Art and Animation 🖼️ <small>(textures, models, animations, etc.)</small>
* Sound and Musics 🎺 <small>(musics, sounds, effects, etc.)</small>
* User Interface 🕹️ <small>(menus, overlays, etc.)</small>
* Programming 🤖 <small>(game engines, scripts, templates, etc.)</small>

There are many tools and online resources that leverage the process of making a game, allowing independent developers to publish their games. They mostly use the [itch.io](https://itch.io/) platform.

Many projects are cancelled, especially games. 

* 🕹️ Always have a working version for others to test it
* 🗺️ Do the minimum first, don't try to do everything at once
* ✍️ It's often not possible to release a bug-free game. Sometimes, it's better to release something to get some feedback.

Game development is structured in at least 4 phases:

* Planning
* Development
* Testing
* Release

## User Interface (UI)

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

The User Interface (UI) represents everything that we are showing to the user, such as a health/stamina/mana bar, a minimap, shortcuts for skills, an in-game chat, a settings icon, dialogs, looting messages, etc.

The major aspects when dealing with UI are:

* 🐣 Usability <small>(easy to learn, easy to remember actions, easy to use)</small>
* 🦋 Aesthetics <small>(match the style of your game, immersive, look good)</small>
* 👍 Entertaining <small>(Microinteractions, feedback)</small>

Epurated interfaces such as in Skyrim are called diegetic interfaces.
