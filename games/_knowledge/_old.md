* A [GitHub repository with another long list](https://github.com/Kavex/GameDev-Resources)
* If you are on unity, [you got the Unity Assets Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) üôÑ

* [boardgamizer](http://www.boardgamizer.com/) ("Board Game Design Idea Generator")
* [Video Game Name Generator](https://videogamena.me/) (üòÇ)

## Sprites

* [RpgMaker kind of characters - generator](https://junkhunt.net/vx/charachip.shtml) (generate 2D characters in many directions+faces, using RPGMaker character generator, online, free, in Japanese)
* [Game Character Hub](https://www.gamecharacterhub.com/) (generate 2D characters in many directions+faces, using RPGMaker character generator, paid?)
* If you are using PVGames sprites, you can use [Nightmare_82 tool](https://gitlab.com/Nightmare_82/charactercreator/) to generate faces, sprites in a lot of versions (jump, walk, sleeping, etc.), and in 8 directions.

> Generate some avatars with [joeschmoe](https://joeschmoe.io/). You can check [humaaans](https://humaaans.com/) or [ira](https://iradesign.io/) too. I doubt you will use any of these in a game, but maybe somewhere else?
