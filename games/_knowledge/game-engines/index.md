# Games Engines

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Starting developing a video game from scratch is a bad idea. Most video games are sharing the same base that can be reused.

A game engine will deal with a lot of things related to the hardware <small>(sound, io, graphics)</small> and let us focus on our game <small>(quests, inventory, levels)</small>.

Picking a game engine is usually a choice based on:

* The targeted platforms for our game 🧐
* The knowledge of the team 😎
* The features of the game engine 🚀
* The price and/or the license constraints ✨
* The community, support, and documentation 📚
