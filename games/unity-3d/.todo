3D GO using Rigidbody, one unit = one meter

Z-fighting
=> two items at the same location, overlapping
=> bug when rendering
=> trick: increase the z-values by 0.01

-----------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------- Terrain
-----------------------------------------------------------------

https://fertile-soil-productions.itch.io/mast

=> terrain => increase height (shift decrease) => soften
"seamless textures are the best"
import package => terrain assets
=> edit textures => add => color
=> 5 icon => tree => add => mass place
=> add leaf on trees => set a material on each leaf group + each branch
=> 6 icon => add grass / detail mesh

------------------------- Animation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mixamo
=> FBX model => import
=> Select animation
    => download (FBX, 60 FPS, no keyframe reduction)
    => check "in-place" then download (Collada =textures, once, FBX for unity = model + animation) => animation+character?

Import FBX in unity
=> animation type => humanoid
=> configure avatar definition => match our character
=> animation => loop => bake into pose???
=> ??? click on materials => extract => fix now

Packages: Cinemachine, LeanTween (+TMPro, Timeline)

=> Add cinemachine brain to our camera
=> create new virtual camera
	1. => follow target => body set the position
	   => feel nicer (camera respond to every movement bad) increasing damping (time to adjust)
	   => there is a point, and a dead zone
	   => if the point is too far away from the dead zone, then we are rotation/moving/... the camera => damping
	    => width/height reduced?
	    => reposition focus point with ScreenX/ScreenY
	2. => look at target
=> you can set the priority to tell the cinemachine which camera it should pick

Timeline => switch between cameras
Window => Test Runner => create => remove track and add
	player => add animation track on player
	camera as cinematic track => add shot clip => pick camera
		=> overlap two camera to made a nice transition

If you are creating a timeline, reset transform, remove animator and default track
if you are not planning to use it.

Animation / Character skeleton "rig"
=> start recording you are moving something => you may go back in time and do something too
=> ... => ms to s
=> right-click frames and clip

Click on clip
=> Post extrapolate (when done): ping ping ("undo")

You can create a track group (left column) and group tracks

Activation track
=> enable/disable something

Multi-aim constraint
=> head => aim at a target
