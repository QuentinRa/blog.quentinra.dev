I found this picture a while back on [envato-tuts+ / Game Development](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/). This is quite easy to understand that a **game engine** will deal for you about a lot of things related to the tech/hardware <small>(sound, io, graphics)</small> and let you focus on your game <small>(quests, inventory, levels, ...)</small>.

Picking a game engine is usually a choice based on

* The supported platforms for the released game üßê
* If the team know about this game engine üòé
* If this game engine is proving most of the features you want üöÄ
* If the price, and/or the license is matching your needs ‚ú®
* If it is documented, easy to learn, and you got great support ‚ú®

## Lifecycle and game loop

Usually, in any game, you got the following lifecycle (`structure/cycle de vie`). First, the game is **initialized**, then the core of the game is run, called **game loop**

* **input**: check what button/keys were pressed
* **update**: update the game, according to the state and the input
* **render**: redraw the screen

And when the user closes the game, we are **disposing** of everything.

> In a lot of libraries and even inside game engines, you can find references to this with methods called `render` or `update`.

## Input and FPS

The value called **Frames Per Second** (FPS, `images par second`) is **the number of times in one second the game loop is looping**. Unfortunately, the graphic card may not call the game loop with a constant time <small>(ig: not every 1ms)</small>. This may be because the update was slower, the render was slower, or they were too fast üòé. The side effect is that you may see something teleport, or not moving smoothly. To prevent that from happening, you need to use the **delta time** (=time since when the last call) every time you are moving (or rotating/...) something.

> **TL;DR**: check for something called the "delta time" when you are updating the values of something, to make sure that you are moving something at a **constant** speed, etc.
