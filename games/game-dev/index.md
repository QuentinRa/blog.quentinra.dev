# Game development

I took note of many advices, and links that may be useful when developing a game. This is my summary.

Game development is structured in 3 phases

* Planning
* Development
* Production/Release

As many project are **canceled**, it's quite important for neophytes (and others too) to

* **Always have a working version** ðŸš€, so that you or others can see what you got now, and you can test things anytime
* **Do the minimum for your game to be playable**: No need to make your goal "The Witcher3", and in the end, cancel everything. Start with a map, then add a player, etc. Add things little by little. And keep your big goals under the carpet, while slowly coming near them.
* **Release!**: even if the game has yet to be the game of the year ðŸ˜‚, and you got some minor bugs, users feedback may influence a lot your planning
