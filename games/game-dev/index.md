# Game development

I took note of many advices, and links that may be useful when developing a game. This is my summary.

Game development is structured in 3 phases

* Planning
* Development
* Production/Release

As many project are **canceled**, it's quite important for neophytes (and others too) to

* **Always have a working version** 🚀, so that you or others can see what you got now, and you can test things anytime
* **Do the minimum for your game to be playable**: No need to make your goal "The Witcher3", and in the end, cancel everything. Start with a map, then add a player, etc. Add things little by little. And keep your big goals under the carpet, while slowly coming near them.
* **Release!**: even if the game has yet to be the game of the year 😂, and you got some minor bugs, users feedback may influence a lot your planning

## 2. Development

### 2.1. Tools for your game

Starting a game from scratch is really fun 😎✨, you will learn a lot of things about what game engines are actually doing for you. But, it's costing a **lot of time**, and aside from learning something, you are simply trying to reinvent the wheel 🎡, which I not a good idea.

* you should pick a **game engine** (ex: `Unity`, `Unreal engine`, etc.)
* or you should pick a **library** (ex: `LibGDX`, etc.)

It may be weird too, but you may also used **templates** in a game engine. Because a lot of developers are working on the same game engine, you could expect that some developers would build a sort of game engine, inside a game engine, but targeting one game, or one kind of games. [You can learn more about this, in this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG0GVLYzkus). My recommendation are [More Mountains assets](https://moremountains.com/unity-assets).

### 2.2. Tools for coding

You could use **VSCode**, or Jetbrains IDEs <small>(**CLion** for C++, **Rider** for C#)</small> if you are a student, or you got some money 🤑.

### 2.3. Other tips

* Always define who should do what (good planning)
* Do not stay too much time on details/not quite relevant things (on small games)
