# Unity Editor 🕹️

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

The Unity Editor is where we will build and assemble our games. Unity Editor versions are managed by [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub) which can download [here](https://unity.com/pricing#plans-student-and-hobbyist).

It's recommended to pick a LTS version of the Unity Editor, as they are stable versions. They will still receive patches for 2 years.

✍️ Heavily refer to the [Official Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html).

🚀 There are multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Some may use buttons, some may use shortcuts, others may use the toolbar.
