# Unity Editor 🕹️

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

The Unity Editor is where we will build and assemble our games. Unity Editor versions are managed by [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub) which can download [here](https://unity.com/pricing#plans-student-and-hobbyist).

It's recommended to pick a LTS version of the Unity Editor, as they are stable versions. They will still receive patches for 2 years.

✍️ Heavily refer to the [Official Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html).

🚀 There are multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Some may use buttons, some may use shortcuts, others may use the toolbar.

## Component-based architecture

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Game Object

Every entity in the game world is a game object:

* Characters and Items
* Lights and Cameras
* Sounds and Musics
* UI Elements
* ...

A game object can contain other game objects.

📚 Prefabs are preconfigured GameObjects that we can create and reuse throughout our project.

#### Components

Unity uses a component-based architecture, where you attach various components to GameObjects to give them specific functionality.

Every game object has a TransformComponent handling the position, rotation, and scale of a Game object.

We can create our components using [Scripts](/games/unity/scripts/index.md).

#### Scenes

Scenes are individual levels or sections of your game. We often have one scene per screen.

## Unity Editor Interface

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div class="mt-3">

![Editor Interface](_images/editor_interface.png)
</div><div>

The editor is divided into four windows:

1. **hierarchy window** 📚: list of all game objects in the scene
2. **scene window** 🛠: show the scene tab by default.
    * **scene tab**: edit your scene 
    * **game tab**: run your scene
3. **inspector window** ⚙: edit the properties of the selected object
4. **project window** 🗄: all of your project files

➡️ When running the game, the scene tab will still be available, but any changes to it will be discarded when the simulation stops.

✍️ Some are using a color tint <small>(Edit > Preferences > Colors > Playmode tint)</small> to visually see when their changes will be discarded.

## Basic Editor Usage

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Hierarchy window

The order of elements is important in 2D. Elements at the top are rendered before/below the ones at the bottom.

You can nest game objects inside game objects. While it make everything looks cleaner, too much nesting decreases performance.

#### Scene window

You can move, rotate, and scale game objects. You can also change your point of view by clicking on an axis. Click back on the square to go back to Perspective.

</div>

A few shortcuts:

* <kbd>F</kbd> to focus a game object
* <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> to zoom/de-zoom
* <kbd>Left-Click/Middle-click</kbd> to move your point of view
* <kbd>CTRL</kbd> when moving something will update the position by 0.25
* <kbd>CTRL</kbd>/<kbd>SHIFT</kbd> to select multiple game objects
