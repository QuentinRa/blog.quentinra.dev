# Unity Editor 🕹️

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

The Unity Editor is where we will build and assemble our games. Unity Editor versions are managed by [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub) which can download [here](https://unity.com/pricing#plans-student-and-hobbyist).

It's recommended to pick a LTS version of the Unity Editor, as they are stable versions. They will still receive patches for 2 years.

✍️ Heavily refer to the [Official Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html).

🚀 There are multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Some may use buttons, some may use shortcuts, others may use the toolbar.

## Component-based architecture

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Game Object

Every entity in the game world is a game object:

* Characters and Items
* Lights and Cameras
* Sounds and Musics
* UI Elements
* ...

A game object can contain other game objects.

📚 Prefabs are preconfigured GameObjects that we can create and reuse throughout our project.

#### Components

Unity uses a component-based architecture, where you attach various components to GameObjects to give them specific functionality.

Every game object has a TransformComponent handling the position, rotation, and scale of a Game object.

We can create our components using [Scripts](/games/unity/scripts/index.md).
