## PREV

Scripts are in **C#**, an old version of C#. From [this page about the C# compiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.3/Documentation/Manual/CSharpCompiler.html), Unity 2020.3 (LTS) is using **C# 8.0**. In **2021.2+**, they are using **C# 9.0**. You should also note that even if they are using versions 8.0 or 9.0, **every feature of C# is not available** (check on the page above, for "Unsupported features").

Right-click inside the **project window**, create a new Folder "Scripts" and a new script (ex: "Example.cs").

* the name of the class must be the name of the file
* the name must start with an uppercase, following the UpperCamelCase format

```cs
using UnityEngine;

public class Example : MonoBehaviour // Example.cs
{
    // Awake is called when the script instance is being loaded
    private void Awake() { }

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    private void Start() { }

    // Update is called once per frame
    private void Update() { }
}
```
</div><div>

* **using**

The `using` keyword is importing a namespace, meaning a collection of classes, enums, ... This allows us to use `MonoBehaviour` instead of prefixing classes (`UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour`).

* **MonoBehaviour**

A MonoBehaviour is the base class for a Script. It got a lot of methods, that are called automatically (Awake, Start, Update, Event-related functions, ...) in which you can write some code.

> A script is a component, so you can add it to a game object as usual. You can also drag and drop a script on a game object in the hierarchy.

* **More**

You can write new methods, add new attributes, ... See the [C# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/). If you are familiar with Java, it's easy to sail in C#.

<details class="details-e">
<summary>Game object</summary>

**You attached your script to a Game object**. We already saw in the section

* "Game objects" how to get the name, tag, ...
* "Components" how to get a component attached on the same game object (its children or its parent)

> **Pro tip**: If needed, you got the attribute `gameObject` (resp. `this.gameObject`).

There is another problem. Let's say you want to **reference another game object** in another script. There are multiple ways to do this

* use tags, and find object with tag
* use SerializedFields (see [Unity Script++](../unity-ufs/index.md#serialize-field))
* use the approach explained in the UI section, way better for UI elements

Vector3.back, Vector3.down, Vector3.up, ...
someVector.normalized; // magnitude=1, just a direction
Vector3.MoveTowards(current, target, maxDistancePerStep);
Vector3.Reflex(inDirection, inNormal) // sort of mirror, bounce
if (Vector3.Distance(a, b) <= 0.0001f) {} // a near b?
