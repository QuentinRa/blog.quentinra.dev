## TileMap

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

A tilemap is a grid in which each cell is an image called a tile. It's a common way to create 2D Levels. They can be Rectangular or Isometric. TileMaps can be created using external tools such as [Tiled](/games/_knowledge/game-tools/index.md#content-map-generation-tools).

From the editor, you can:

* Create a Palette
* Create Tile Layers (ex: Ground, Props, etc.)
* Place the tiles on the tilemap

Creating Layers allows us to superpose tiles. In Unity, we create a Grid, and each tilemap is a layer.

ðŸ“š See also: the property `Order in Layer`.
