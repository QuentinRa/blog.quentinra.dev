# Unity Animations ðŸŽ¬

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Unity Cinematic capabilities are quite powerful. They are fully illustrated in [The Heretic Short Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQZobAhgayA) which was fully made in Unity using Animations and Cinematics.

## Particles âœ¨

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Add the "particle system" component to a game object for it to emit particles. By default, they are purple, but because there is no material.

* **Renderer > Material**: set the material for the particles
* **Emission**
    * You can set the number of particles per second
    * You can add bursts of particles
* **Shape**: you can change the shape of the effect
* **Trails**: you can give a trail to your particles
* **Color over lifetime**: you can change the color over time

## ðŸ‘» To-do ðŸ‘»

Stuff that I found, but never read/used yet.

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Cinemachine, LeanTween, and Timeline packages

* Add cinemachine brain to our camera
* Create a new virtual camera.
* You could have one camera looking at the target
* You could have one camera following the target. Set body to the position. Increase damping (time to adjust). If the point is too far, rotate or move the camera.
* Use timeline to switch between cameras

Set the priority to tell the cinemachine which camera it should pick.
