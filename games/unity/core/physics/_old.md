# Rigidbody (Physics üê±‚Äçüèç)


**Pro tip**: updating physics must be done in the method `FixedUpdate` <small>(running at 50 FPS, even if the game is running at 20 FPS)</small> instead of `Update`. In `Update`, you will process input (calls to Input.Something), and in `FixedUpdate`, you will ONLY update the force, you won't call Input.Something (use attributes to remember what key/... were pressed).

```cs
// if up then Jump, etc.
rb.AddForce(Vector3.left); // move to the left
rb.AddForce(Vector3.left * speed);
rb.AddForce(Vector3.left * speed, ForceMode.A_MODE_HERE);
rb.MovePosition(position);
rb.AddExplosionForce(power, explosionPos, radius, 3.0F);
```

## Colliders

Colliders are used to check if our game object is colliding with another object. You will define a collider covering your game object (up to you, whether only touching the bust is considered as colliding=more efficient, etc.). Once you created your collider, **it will be triggered each time a game object having a Rigidbody is entering your collider**.

1. **Create**: by default, the collider will fit your object, more or less according to the kind of collider you picked. You can click on edit collider. If you are zooming a lot, you will see small green dots. Click on them to edit your collider in one direction. **Pro tip**: use rectangular colliders for better performances <small>(ex: not a good example but, you can make one covering the bust rather than the whole player)</small>.
2. **is trigger**
    1. if **false**, this object is solid, trigger the method `OnCollisionEnter(Collision)`.
    2. if **true**, objects are passing through each other, trigger the method `OnTriggerEnter(Collider)`.
3. **Layers**
    * by default, objects may collide even if there are not on the same layer.
    * You can change this behavior by tweaking the collision matrix at the end of Edit > Project Settings > Physics
4. **Physical material**
    * it's an asset "create > Physic Material" in the project explorer
    * you can set every friction to 0, and set combine to "minimum" to disable friction.
    * then you can add it to a collider
5. **Some Code** (3 ways that I used)

```cs
// 1. return every collider inside this sphere
Physics.OverlapsSphere(position, radius)
// only layers in mask (ex: mask = LayerMask.GetMask("Default", "Water"))
Physics.OverlapsSphere(position, radius, mask)
// 2. you can use Vector3.Distance (or Vector2)
// 3. you can use Bounds.Intersects
GetComponent<Collider>().bounds.Intersects(anotherBounds);
GetComponent<Renderer>().bounds.Intersects(anotherBounds);
```

| | Collider | Collider (isTrigger) | Collider+Rigidbody | Collider+Rigidbody (kinematic) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collider | x | x | OnCollisionEnter | x |
| Collider (isTrigger) | x  | x | OnTriggerEnter | OnTriggerEnter |
| Collider+Rigidbody | OnCollisionEnter | OnTriggerEnter | OnCollisionEnter | OnCollisionEnter |
| Collider+Rigidbody (kinematic) | x | OnTriggerEnter | OnCollisionEnter | x |

> **Pro tip**: this may not be the best way to do it, but methods such as `OnCollisionEnter` are filled with the game object we are colliding with. You may use tags, and check the tag of the game object.
