## Version Control in Unity

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

Version control systems are used to keep track of the different versions of a project. Learn more about [Version Control](/tools-and-frameworks/vcs/_general/index.md) here. 

Unity projects commonly use [Git](/tools-and-frameworks/vcs/git/_general/index.md). 

These folders are generated and should not be stored on Git:

* `Library`
* `Temp`
* `Logs`
* `Packages`

Avoid storing big files <small>(images, artist files, etc.)</small> too.

Since it can be hard to learn, we often use plugins or tools such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) which handle git commands for us.

There are also Git plugins inside Unity:

* [GitHub for Unity](https://unity.github.com/) <small>(⚠️, dead)</small> 
* [git-for-unity](https://github.com/spoiledcat/git-for-unity) <small>(🚀, fork of GitHub for Unity)</small>
* ...

The main problem is that they store big files using [Git LFS](/tools-and-frameworks/vcs/git/commands/index.md#-git-large-file-storage) which is mostly a paid service as it has impractical limitations for free users.
