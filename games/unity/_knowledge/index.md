To use and download Unity, you need to subscribe to a plan: personal, student, professional, etc.

* [Unity Download Page](https://unity.com/pricing#plans-student-and-hobbyist)
* It will trigger the download of [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub)
* With it, you can select which version(s) of Unity you want to install

➡️ It's recommended to pick a LTS version of the Unity Editor, as they are stable versions. They will still receive patches for 2 years.

🏫 Before, Unity offered [Snaps student bundle](https://assetstore.unity.com/browse/student-plan-pack) at $1 for students. Now, they can redeem the [Synty student bundle](https://assetstore.unity.com/student-plan-pack1).
