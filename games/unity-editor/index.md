# Unity Editor

As there is a lot of content about Unity, this course will only provide knowledge about the **editor itself** such as the **interface**, the **project structure**, **along with everything that is not 2D/3D-specific** such as handling **scenes**, **input**, etc.

> The previous course was about **general knowledge** related to [Unity](../unity/index.md)<br>
> You can dig more into **2D** with [Unity 2D](../unity-2d/index.md)<br>
> You can dig more into **3D** with [Unity 3D](../unity-3d/index.md)
