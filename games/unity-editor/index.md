# Unity Editor

As there is a lot of content about Unity, this course will only provide knowledge about the **editor itself** such as the **interface**, the **project structure**, **along with everything that is not 2D/3D-specific** such as handling **scenes**, **input**, etc.

> The previous course was about **general knowledge** related to [Unity](../unity/index.md)<br>
> You can dig more into **2D** with [Unity 2D](../unity-2d/index.md)<br>
> You can dig more into **3D** with [Unity 3D](../unity-3d/index.md)

## Game object

Everything in Unity is a **game object**. **Players**, **enemies**, **items**, **camera**, **sounds**, **UI elements**, **lights**, and so on, are **game objects**. it means that they got the following properties

<details class="details-s">
<summary>A <b>name</b> ‚ú®: for you to know what's this game object</summary>

```cs
string myName = name; // or this.name or this.gameObject.name
```
</details>

<details class="details-s">
<summary>A <b>tag</b> üè∑: Quite useful. You can add a tag "enemy" <small>(you can create tags)</small> and check the tag of a game object to know if this is an "enemy". You can also find game objects by tag name.</summary>

```cs
string myTag = tag; // or this.tag or this.gameObject.tag
GameObject g = GameObject.FindWithTag("tag"); // null if not found
GameObject obj = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("tag"); // FindWithTag is an alias of this one
GameObject[] objects = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("tag");
```
</details>

<details class="details-s">
<summary>A state "<b>enabled</b>" ü§ö. You can enabled/disable your game object. If a game object is disabled, it won't be updated anymore.</summary>

```cs
bool isEnabled = enabled;
```

> **Pros**: they are disabling game objects that are far from the camera, and enabling game objects near the camera. Some game objects may be visible even if the camera is far, you may handle that too.
</details>

<details class="details-s">
<summary><b>Transform</b> ‚öô: a <b>component</b> handling the position, rotation, and scale of a Game object.</summary>

```cs
Transform myTransform = transform; // transform.position, ...
myTransform.LookAt(target);
myTransform.Rotate(axis, angle);
myTransform.Rotate(axis, Time.deltaTime * angle, Space.World); // or Space.Self
```
</details>

> **Pro tip**: avoid changing the scale, it can cause performances issues, and this will be tiring to manage later.<br>
> **Note**: you will learn more about "**components**" in another section.<br>
> **Note**: you will learn about methods available for game objects in another section.

## Scenes

**Scenes are screens of your games**. For instance, you may have StartMenuScene, LoadingScene, GameScene, GameOverScene, InventoryScene, etc. Of course, you are free, you may split our GameScene in more scenes <small>(ex: one per level?)</small>, or you may merge scenes <small>(ex: GameScene with InventoryScene)</small>. By default, Unity is opening a new project in the "SampleScene".

In Unity, creating a scene will not be enough to make it a part of your game. You need to

* Open the new scene
* File > Build Settings
* Click on "add opened scenes in build" <small>(you may take note of the build index)</small>

Now, you will be able later to switch scenes using this sample of code

```cs
SceneManager.LoadScene(buildIndex);
SceneManager.LoadScene("SceneName");
```

## Interface

When you are opening a project, by default you got 4 windows.

* **hierarchy window** üìö (left): list of all **GameObjects** of your scene
* **scene window** üõ† (middle)
	* **scene tab**: edit your scene
	* **game tab**: run your scene
		* press play to run
		* press play again to stop
		* press pause to pause the simulation

When **running** your game, you can go edit things <small>(either by going back to scene, or by clicking on a game object in the game/hierarchy)</small>, to test things. **Note that everything will be reverted back once you stopped playing**.

* **inspector window** ‚öô (right): you can edit the properties of the selected **GameObject**
* **project window** üóÑ (bottom): all of your project files
