# Unity Editor

As there is a lot of content about Unity, this course will only provide knowledge about the **editor itself** such as the **interface**, the **project structure**, **along with everything that is not 2D/3D-specific** such as handling **scenes**, **input**, etc.

> The previous course was about **general knowledge** related to [Unity](../unity/index.md)<br>
> You can dig more into **2D** with [Unity 2D](../unity-2d/index.md)<br>
> You can dig more into **3D** with [Unity 3D](../unity-3d/index.md)

## Game object

Everything in Unity is a **game object**. **Players**, **enemies**, **items**, **camera**, **sounds**, **UI elements**, **lights**, and so on, are **game objects**. it means that they got the following properties

<details class="details-s">
<summary>A <b>name</b> ‚ú®: for you to know what's this game object</summary>

```cs
string myName = name; // or this.name or this.gameObject.name
```
</details>

<details class="details-s">
<summary>A <b>tag</b> üè∑: Quite useful. You can add a tag "enemy" <small>(you can create tags)</small> and check the tag of a game object to know if this is an "enemy". You can also find game objects by tag name.</summary>

```cs
string myTag = tag; // or this.tag or this.gameObject.tag
GameObject g = GameObject.FindWithTag("tag"); // null if not found
// same as FindWithTag
GameObject obj = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("TagName");
GameObject[] objects = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("TagName");
```
</details>

<details class="details-s">
<summary>A state "<b>enabled</b>" ü§ö. You can enabled/disable your game object. If a game object is disabled, it won't be updated anymore.</summary>

```cs
bool isEnabled = enabled;
```
</details>

<details class="details-s">
<summary><b>Transform</b> ‚öô: a <b>component</b> handling the position, rotation, and scale of a Game object.</summary>

```cs
Transform myTransform = transform; // transform.position, ...
myTransform.LookAt(target);
myTransform.Rotate(axis, angle);
myTransform.Rotate(axis, Time.deltaTime * angle, Space.World); // or Space.Self
```
</details>

> **Pro tip**: avoid changing the scale, it can cause performances issues, and this will be tiring to manager later.<br>
