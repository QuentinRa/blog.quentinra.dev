# Unity Editor

As there is a lot of content about Unity, this course will only provide knowledge about the **editor itself** such as the **interface**, the **project structure**, **along with everything that is not 2D/3D-specific** such as handling **scenes**, **input**, etc.

> The previous course was about **general knowledge** related to [Unity](../unity/index.md)<br>
> You can dig more into **2D** with [Unity 2D](../unity-2d/index.md)<br>
> You can dig more into **3D** with [Unity 3D](../unity-3d/index.md)

## Game object

Everything in Unity is a **game object**. **Players**, **enemies**, **items**, **camera**, **sounds**, **UI elements**, **lights**, and so on, are **game objects**. it means that they got the following properties

* A **name** ‚ú®: for you to know what's this game object
* A **tag** üè∑: Quite useful. You can add a tag "enemy" <small>(you can create tags)</small> and check the tag of a game object to know if this is an "enemy". You can also find game objects by tag name.
* A state "**enabled**" ü§ö. You can enabled/disable your game object. If a game object is disabled, it won't be updated anymore.
* **Transform** ‚öô: a **component** handling the position, rotation, and scale of a Game object.

> **Pro tip**: avoid changing the scale, it can cause performances issues, and this will be tiring to manager later.<br>
> **Note**: you will learn more about "**components**" in another section.<br>
> **Note**: you will learn about methods available for game objects in another section.
