# Tips

A bunch of tips about Unity, this is a summary of every tip I was given.

## Optimization

The image size must be a power of two, so you can compress it. You can compress sounds too (50% seems good).

Activate and deactivate objects if the camera is close or far from them.

## Logic

Use `Debug.log("")` to add logs of your game.

You can and should group variables. You can use `[Header("name")]` / `[Space(value)]` before your variables declarations.

In RigidBodyComponent, in `Interpolate`, enable interpolation for the main character, as the [documentation is suggesting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody-interpolation.html).

## Graphics

Enable `post-processing` in rendering.
