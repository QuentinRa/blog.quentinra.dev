Unity is providing generic support for your games, sometimes you may want more. You can add **plugins** for that. For instance, the [TopDownEngine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/topdown-engine-89636) (a **paid** asset) is providing a lot of help to create 2D/3D TopDownGames <small>(check "templates" on the unity store to see what you could expect from game templates, as you may save a lot of time with them)</small>.

In **Unity** everything, I mean everything (entities, light, images, etc.) is a **Game object**. I think that this is their own way of implementing an **architectural pattern** called **Entity-component-system** (ECS), but I'm unsure of it <small>(I'm still learning ðŸ˜–)</small>.
