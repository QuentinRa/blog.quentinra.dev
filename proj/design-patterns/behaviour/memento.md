# Memento or token

[Go back](..)

You can use this to save an object. That may be used
by undo/redo application but in fact, it cost a bit
too much so not many seems to use it.
In most cases, for an undo-redo, we will save the action
that the user did or the action that we should do to undo it.

## Example

* we consider some states (1,2, ...)
* we create ``Memento`` with the name of the state 
  and the data to save
* we create a class ``Caretaker`` for all your mementos

    * ``add(Memento)``
    * ``get(int)`` (which of the stored memento you want?)

Then on our object, we would add a method

* `getMemento():Memento` : returns the current memento
* `setState(Memento)` : change the state of the object 
according to a memento.
