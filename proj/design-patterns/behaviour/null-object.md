# NullObject

[Go back](..)

In a NullObject, methods are coded using
default behavior

* throws exception
* returns false
* return 0, ...
* returns another NullObject

They are used to let the programmer choose **when** or **how**
he will handle the NullPointerException, because
in some cases, he might not want to handle it
at all and use the default value.

* âœ… : some flexibility
* ðŸš« : one more class to maintain
