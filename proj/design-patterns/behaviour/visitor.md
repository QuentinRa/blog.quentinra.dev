# Visitor

[Go back](..)

A visitor can do methods defined in an interface.
Then you will have concrete classes taking a visitor
and executing (or not) some code.

From what I understood

* create an abstract class with an ``accept`` method, taking a visitor
* a visitor is an interface of the methods that may
  be implemented according to the kind of visitor
* then you create visitors
* and you create concrete classes inheriting
  the abstract class that may do something different
  according to the visitor

I have seen it used in Parser like the Jetbrains
R language parser [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/Rplugin/blob/master/gen/org/jetbrains/r/psi/api/RVisitor.java)
.

There are examples and 
explanations [here](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/visitor/).
