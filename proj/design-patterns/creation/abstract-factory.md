# AbstractFactory or Kit

[Go back](..)

This is a factory of factories where we
we code each method creating a factory like we were doing in ``Factory``.

* ‚û°Ô∏è : drivers SQL manager
* ‚úÖ : good isolation
* üö´ : too much code and maybe too complex

## Example

This is the idea

* Create two abstract classes ``Monster`` and `Human`
* Each one could have subclasses such as ``Gobelin``, `Spider` or `Hero`, `NPC`
* then create the abstract ``AbstractFactory``

    * method ``monster(...) : Monster``
    * method ``human(...) : Human``
    
* then create two factories

    * ``MonsterFactory`` : code ``monster(...) : Monster`` 
    * ``HumanFactory `` : code ``human(...) : Human`` 

* then create a concrete class ``UnitCreator`` which each method
should returns a ``AbstractFactory`` for instance
``getHumanFactory() : AbstractFactory``.
  
In our code, we won't know

* the factories (``MonsterFactory`` and ``HumanFactory ``
  since we are manipulating ``AbstractFactory``)
* the concretes units (since we are using factories)
