# AbstractFactory or Kit

[Go back](..)

This is a factory of factories where we code 
each method creating a factory (like we were doing in ``Factory``).

* âœ… : good isolation
* ðŸš« : too much code and maybe too complex

## Example

This is the idea

* Create two abstract classes ``Monster`` and `Human`
* Each one could have subclasses such as ``Gobelin``, `Spider` or `Hero`, `NPC`
* then create the abstract ``AbstractFactory``
    * method ``monster(...) : Monster``
    * method ``human(...) : Human``
* then create two factories
    * ``MonsterFactory``: we "only" code ``monster(...) : Monster`` 
    * ``HumanFactory ``: we "only" code ``human(...) : Human``
* then create a concrete class ``UnitCreator`` 
  * each method should returns a ``AbstractFactory`` 
  * for instance, ``getHumanFactory() : AbstractFactory``
  
In our code, we won't know

* the factories (``MonsterFactory`` and ``HumanFactory ``
  since we are manipulating ``AbstractFactory``)
* the concretes units (since we are using factories)
