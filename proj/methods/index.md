# Introduction

You may already have ready about

* SOLID, KISS, DRY, ... are in [Code guidelines](../guidelines/index.md)
* Test-driven, Behavior-driven are in [Tests](../tests/index.md)
* Design patterns are in [Design patterns](../design-patterns/index.md)

and in this course, we will introduce other methods, like the Pair-programming method or the Model-driven programming method, that we couldn't introduce somewhere else.

<hr class="sr">

## Pair-programming

This is quite easy. It's usually used in agile projects, since it's one of the extreme programming methods.

> You got **two persons** and **one computer**, one code, while the other
> 
> * gives advice (help, improvements)
> * ask for explications about what's this part of code is supposed to do (hint to add comments)
> * think about problems that may arise (like a wrong argument or an invalid usage)

The two should switch roles at least once in a while. This will help writing a more maintainable code, maybe faster since <q>Four eyes are better than two</q>. It's quite useful to train a new developer, so I'm practicing that a lot when I'm starting a project with a less experienced developer to make sure that they don't waste time on useless stuff and improve their skills faster.

You got tools like VSC/IntelliJ, allowing you to work on your friend's computer and code with him. This may help for debugging the code too, aside from remotely working in pairs.

An extension of this method, where instead of 2, the whole team (ðŸ˜°) is working on one computer, is called [Mob programming (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming).

## Model-driven development (MDD)

You will create a model during the conception phase. Then your code will be the exact representation of the model (same attributes, classes, ...), at least the "public" part of your code. If you need to add something, then first change the model.

This method is quite powerful but will ask you to do quite a lot of work during the conception (since the development will be quite easy and fast, or at least very straightforward).

* [User stories](mdd/user-stories.md)
* [Class diagram](mdd/class.md)
* [Sequence diagram](mdd/seq.md)
* And now code the application. Using StarUML you can generate Java code from your UML diagrams.

Since I don't like wasting my time, I think you should

* do a mock-up of your application (with events... maybe in Bootstrap/JS or using an app)
* then do the **MDD** method

By doing so, you will most likely find more things than doing, again and again, loops, using the sequence diagram to find the missing classes/attributes/relationships... Or coding, then going back to update the model... I'm using Bootstrap, and it makes' it easy to create a mock-up (at least I'm doing this for all my apps, and I feel like it's worth it). Check the [HMI](../hmi/index.md) course to get some help.

## Documentation-driven development

That's something I came up with... or [not](https://gist.github.com/zsup/9434452).

I thought, that it's better when a programmer knows what we are asking him to code before starting to code. The idea is that you should write the documentation first, and the programmer must code exactly what's written in the documentation. If something needs to be changed, then changing the documentation comes first.

This is a sort of "design by contract" kind of method, but it sure helps to have a clear (and not too long) description about what one should code.

**Writing documentation is tiring through** so don't forget **YAGNI**: don't code things that you aren't needing right now ("I will need this later"), since, here, that also means more documentation.

## Data-driven programming

*note*: beware that "data-driven" is also a term used BigData, but that's not the same, we even added "programming".

For this one, you don't need a course, you are most likely already using it. Simply make a program that will adapt itself according to the data provided.

Something like making a file for the configuration and parsing it, making files for the view and render them, making files for your data like the NPC/Quests/... in an RPG instead of writing everything in the code.

When you do that, someone can easily change the data without changing the code (or someone should be able to). If that's the case, then your program is "data-driven".
