# Sequence diagram

[Go back](..)

To make sure that we aren't forgetting something, we will make a sequence diagram of each use case, to check that we created every class and method inside our class diagram.

<hr class="sl">

Execute your program.

* Start with the user calling the ``main`` method
* What variables are created?
* What methods are called?
* What are the values of their arguments?

A sequence diagram is in a way an algorithm of **one instance of your program**, calling the classes and methods that you will define in the **class diagram**.

**Note for StarUML's users**

You should not create new objects/... What I mean is that you defined the classes in the **class diagram** so in the list of components, simply drag and drop them from the class diagram to the sequence diagram.
