# Sequence diagram

[Go back](..)

Execute your program.

* Start with the user calling the ``main`` method
* What variables are created?
* What methods are called?
* What are the values of their arguments?

A sequence diagram is in a way an algorithm of **one instance of your program**, calling the classes and methods that you will define in the **class diagram**.

**StarUML-specific note**

You should not create new objects/... What I mean is that you defined the classes in the **class diagram** so in the list of components, simply drag and drop them from the class diagram to the sequence diagram.
