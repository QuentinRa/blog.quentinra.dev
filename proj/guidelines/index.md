# Introduction

You may have read in other courses about

* test-driven, model-driven, ...
* design patterns (and anti-patterns)
* frameworks

Using these, you will use the knowledge, 
experience and the code
improved by a lot of developers before you.
This course is a gathering of programmers principles
that may help you writing your code.

## Me

Here some of my troughs before starting 

* I think your code should be enough **documented**
  so that the programmer don't take hours trying
  to understand what you tried to do, and not too much
  otherwise they may not read it.
* you shouldn't copy-paste code from another part
  of your code
* you should use frameworks or other programmer works
  (if they are still maintained) rather than rewriting
  everything from scratch and increase
    * your workload
    * the complexity of your code
    * the workload of the futures maintainers
