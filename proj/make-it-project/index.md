# Make IT project

This is not a course that is explaining to you "how to make an IT project", since even I don't fully understand that. But, this is a gathering of

* explanations about the most used files in GIT
* explanations about courses that you might want to look at
* a lot of tips about IT projects (versioning, ...)

This is focused on providing help for open-source projects, but I'm sure that you'll be able to tell what you can do (or not) according to what kind of project you're doing.

## About other courses

If you are planning to make a project, you should consider a version-control tool. The most-used one is **GIT**.

If you are planning to make a project with a team, you should also look at **AGILE-SCRUM** methodology (or Agile methodologies), to replace the traditional V-Model.

If you are planning to make something clean, and well-made, then you should look at 

* **Design patterns**: typical implementations of some concepts
* **Methodologies**: some methodologies you might want to try
* **Code guidelines**: make your code consistent (how parameters are declared? Language? Indents? ...)
* **Tests**: automated tests to test that your software is working as intended, even after some updates
* **HMI**: carefully think about your interface
* **Frameworks**: frameworks that are **actively maintained** might help you save time, while making your code more maintainable and secure

And finally, you should look for the **project management course**, as it explains things like "how to write specifications".

## README.md/README.rst

This is a file you must already know. We are putting a README.md in **Markdown** (or README.rst, if you enjoy ReStructuredText) to explain

* What's the project's **name**
* What's the project's **goal**/ **description** of the project
* How we can **install the project**? Run it? Test it?
* Where is the **documentation**? (you got one, right? Right? üßê)
  * You should add **some samples of code**
  * Of course, you should generate the code's documentation (like the Javadoc, the JSDoc, ...)
  * Write runtimes usages (global variables, the usage of a session for a website, ...)
* Some **badges** (see fancy notes in the course about GIT)
* You may add **pictures/a GIF** showing an **example** of what's the project doing
* A link to a demo
* Credits/Authors and core maintainers (with a way to contact them)

You may also

* Add the contributors (some are doing it)
* Add a link to other files (such as the LICENSE)

<hr class="sl">

## LICENSE/LICENSE.txt

You **must** add a LICENSE, the most used ones being

* the MIT license
* the Apache license, version 2.0
* the [creative common kinds of licenses](https://creativecommons.org/)
* Copyright (default - no license)

Pick the one that is corresponding to what you want [on choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/).

## CONTRIBUTING.md

Tell others, how they can contribute to your project

* How issues are handled?
* How pull requests are handled?
* What guidelines are you following?

<hr class="sl">

## CHANGELOG.md

This is useful to help the developers know what you did, or everything major that happened. The website [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/#how) is giving you a lot of help.

* latest to oldest
* for each version
  * give the release date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  * tell us what you added/changed
  * tell us what you deprecated/removed/fixed
  * you may link issues, pull requests, and commits

On GitHub, the **releases** could be an alternative to the CHANGELOG.md, or you can use both.

You got tools that may help you generate a changelog, but I didn't test them

* [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator)
* [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog)

## CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

What behavior is tolerated? What's behavior isn't tolerated? You should explain this in the Code Of Conduct.

The most used template is the [Contributor Covenant (Markdown - 2.1)](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md), you can [find the latest version here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

You can add this badge too, if you're proud of it ![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)

```markdown
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
```

<hr class="sl">

## SECURITY.md

You should give a way for users to report any security-related issues. You may also write in this file, 

* which versions of your software will have security updates, 
* or for how much time you're planning to provide security updates, for each version

Sometimes, even if you moved to another major version (like from v1 to v2), you will still provide security updates for the previous versions. We usually call these versions "Long-Term Support" (LTS). For instance, Java LTS versions are released every 5 years, we got Java11 and soon Java17.

If you're tenacious and motivated, you might read [about security practices here](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/main/doc/security.md). I haven't read enough to make you a summary.

<hr class="sr">

## Templates

I'm including two things into "templates".

* **Repository templates**

Maybe someone already configured a repository for you. On GitHub, you can find "template" repositories that are expressly made to be used as a template. 

* [git-repository-template](https://github.com/misitebao/template-git-repository),
* [opensource-template](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/opensource-template)

Note that you may find node-project templates too, etc.

* **Issues and pull requests templates**

I don't know if you can do that everywhere, but on GitHub, you can define templates for your issues and your pull requests. Everything is explained in the Git course.

<hr class="sl">

## Workflows

Usually, developers are configuring automatic testing or actions that are executed each time they're making a commit/pull request. An action could

* check that the code is compiling on some OS
* check that the code is covered by the tests
* check that you didn't have introduced a security breach
* ...

On GitHub, the concept of workflow is associated with the [notion of actions](https://fr.github.com/features/actions). You got a lot of fancy tools/actions introduced in the fancy notes in the Git course.

<hr class="sr">

## Versioning

It seems that a lot of persons are using

* The [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)
  * FORMAT: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**
    * MAJOR: breaking change (of the API)
    * MINOR: non-breaking change, backward compatible
    * PATCH: internal change
  * **0.y.z**: in development
  * **1.y.z**: stable
  * you may add a tag like **1.0.0-alpha**
* You may also check [Calver](https://calver.org/)

<hr class="sl">

## Bunch of notes

In an open-source project,

* make every discussion public
* check the license of the libraries you're using
* give your roadmap (what you're planning to do, what you did, ...)
* try to answer any issues/pull requests within 48 hours, give feedback and gratitude to your contributors
* **CODEOWNERS**: at least on GitHub, you can create a file called [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners). You can use regex to tell GitHub who wrote these files. When someone is submitting a pull request/issue changing the file assigned to an author, GitHub will automatically ask for their review.
