# Make IT project

This is not a course explaining you "how to make an it project", since even I don't fully understand that. This course is a gathering of

* explanations about the most used files in GIT
* explanations about courses that you might want to look at
* a lot of tips about IT projects (versioning, ...)

You may note right now this: This course is mixing things that open-source users will do, and if your project won't be open-source, some advices here might not apply.

## About other courses

If you are planning to make a project, of course you should consider a version-control tool. The most-used one is **GIT**.

If you are planning to make a project with a team, you should also look at **AGILE-SCRUM** methodology (or Agile methodologies), to replace this old V-Model.

If you are planning to make something clean, and well-made, then you should look at 

* **Design patterns**: typical implementations of some concepts
* **Methodologies**: some methodologies you might want to try
* **Code guidelines**: make your code consistent (how parameters are declared? language? indents? ...)
* **Tests**: automated tests to test that your software is working as intended, even after some updates
* **HMI**: carefully think about your interface

And finally, you should look for the **project management course**, as it explain thinks like "how to write specifications".
