# Scrum master

[Go back](../index.md#whats-scrum)

The **Scrum master** is making sure that the developers are focusing only on the development, and not on applying Scrum. He should organize meeting, and deal with everything so that the project is going smoothly.

This is a bit similar to a project leader (`chef de projet`), but there is no such thing in Agile.

## Some advice

Try to relay as much as possible information in your group. Be sure to ask others

* What are they doing?
* What will they do? How will they tackle a task?
* What do they want to do?

and try to give them advice, be it person-to-person or talk about it, and ask for everyone's help in the **daily scrum** (explained later).

**Why?**

By asking them what they are doing, even if they are doing fine, you may help them get new ideas and improve their skills. It will broaden their horizons, and yours too, since both of you are seeing how the other would tackle a problem.

By asking them what they will do, you will check with them that you have the same understanding of what they need to do and how they could tackle this. You can give them tips/advice or help them sail easier in their task.

Finally, you should ask each person what they want to do, because when someone isn't motivated, then you may have to redo their work, they may create bugs too, because they are not focused, slowing down everything. You must give them tasks that they will enjoy and do their best to make.
