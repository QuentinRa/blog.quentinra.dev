# Scrum master

[Go back](../index.md#whats-scrum)

The **Scrum master** is making sure that the developers are focusing only on the development, and not on applying Scrum. He should organize meeting, and deal with everything so that the project is going smoothly.

This is a bit similar to a project leader (`chef de projet`), but there is no such thing in Agile.
