# Product Owner

[Go back](../index.md#whats-scrum)

The **Product Owner** is the only one talking to the client. He will redact a product backlog, which is almost like a specification (`cahier des charges`). He will lead the demonstration, and overview that the developers are correctly doing what the client wanted.

## Product Backlog

This is a list of what the client wants. You must filter the tasks by priorities, most likely using the **MoSCoW** notation.

* **M**: Must have this
* **S**: Should have this
* **C**: Could have this
* **W**: Would have this

You may ask the client about the priority and/or deduct it by yourself, since some tasks that the client wants may be too hard/useless if done in the first increment.
