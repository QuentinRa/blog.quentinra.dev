# Daily scrum

[Go back](../index.md#whats-scrum)

The **daily scrum**, **stand-up**, or `mêlée quotidienne`, is a **15 minutes** meeting/reunion, no more. You may skip these meetings in small teams, or not do them daily but weekly.

If you are **seriously trying to do it**, **then do it really**: you must prepare something like the **daily order** (`ordre du jour`), or ask each person about what they will do today. Try to do it in a way that will help, and not just because you are practicing **Scrum**.

You must use these reunions to assert that everyone knows perfectly what they have to do and won't code something that was not requested.

## My advice

Try to relay as much as possible information in your group. Be sure to ask others

* What are they doing?
* What will they do? How will they tackle a task?
* What do they want to do?

For instance, as a Scrum master, I was having a **person-to-person** talk with easy developer. I was going to their desk, and asked them those questions. You should ask them, if they want you to do that, or how many times you should ask <small>(ex: 1 per functionality?)</small>. You may also ask everyone's help/feedback in the **daily scrum**.

**Why?**

By asking them what they are doing, even if they are doing fine, you may help them get new ideas and improve their skills. It will broaden their horizons, and yours too, since both of you are seeing how the other would tackle a problem.

By asking them what they will do, you will check with them that you have the same understanding of what they need to do and how they could tackle this. You can give them tips/advice or help them sail easier in their task.

You should ask each person what they want to do, because when someone isn't motivated, then you may have to redo their work, they may create bugs too, because they are not focused, slowing down everything. You must give them tasks that they will enjoy and do their best to make.

Finally, if you are making small person-to-person meeting, the trouble of handling daily-meeting might decrease, and you may prevent the **feeling of being bored of daily meetings**.
