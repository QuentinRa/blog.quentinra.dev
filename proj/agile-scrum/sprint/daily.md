# Daily scrum

[Go back](..)

A ``15 minutes`` reunion, not more. You may skip theses reunions
in small teams or not do them daily but weekly.

If you really try to do it, then do it really :
you must prepare something like the daily order, or
ask each person about what they will do today. Try to it
in a way that will help and not just because you are
doing ``scrum``.

You must use theses reunions to assert that
everyone knows perfectly what they have to do and won't
code something that was not requested.
