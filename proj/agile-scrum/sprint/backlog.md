# Sprint backlog

[Go back](..)

It's usually a board with post-its. We now do it
online mainly using one of theses

* [Trello](https://trello.com/)
* [Github](https://github.com/features/project-management)
* [YouTrack (jetbrains)](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/)

All of theses are free.

We will have three columns

* ``Todo`` : what must to be done
* ``In-progress`` : working on it
* ``Done`` : done

Your aim will be to move all of your cards in ``Done``.
