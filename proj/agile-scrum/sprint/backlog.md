# Sprint backlog

[Go back](..)

It's usually a board with post-its. 
You may do it online, and if you do, we are mainly using 
one of these tools (all free)

* [Trello](https://trello.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/features/project-management)
* [YouTrack (JetBrains)](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/)

<hr class="sl">
<br>

We will have three columns

* **Todo**: what have to be done
* **In-progress**: working on it
* **Done**: done

You will aim to move all of your cards in **Done**.
