# Sprint retrospective

[Go back](../index.md#whats-scrum)

Use this time to think about **what didn't work well** and of course **what worked well**, so that you may improve your working conditions, for your next **sprint**.

At the end, you must select **one thing** to improve your sprints, and focus on it. You may try to improve other things too, but focusing on one is making sure that I least one thing will improve per sprint.
