# Sprint retrospective

[Go back](..)

Use this time to think about

* what didn't work well
* what worked well

so that you may start in better conditions your
next `sprint`.

Think about

* tools
* peoples
* directives
* processes
* ...

**Note** : You can do this retrospective in the middle
of a sprint.
