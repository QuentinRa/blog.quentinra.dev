# Sprint Planning

[Go back](..)

The main goal is to decide your ``Sprint goal``
meaning what you want to made at the end of the sprint.
The result of your sprint is called ``increment``.

Usually a sprint last ``4 weeks``.

In the sprint planning, you must decides
the functionalities that must be coded in order to fulfill
you sprint goal. To be exact, you need to split a functionality
in a list of things to do such as this dumb examples

Client requested a frame for a desktop application

* make the frame without content
* make the toolbar
* make the screen XXXX
* ...

And split again, until each task can be done in some hours.

You will manage all of theses task in your ``Sprint backlog``.

## Evaluates the time

Sometimes, we put the time needed in order to do a task on it. 
A little game is to ask everyone to write on a paper
how much time they thing a task will take, then the
average value may be used as an answer. 

The list of values must be set, like

* 0
* 1/2
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 5
* 8
* 13
* 20
* 40
* 100
* ?
* inf.

unit is up to your liking. If you have a hard time giving a value, then
instead a using values, ask peoples to sort the tasks
because that should be possible 2 by 2.
