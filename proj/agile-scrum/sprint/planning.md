# Sprint Planning

[Go back](../index.md#whats-scrum)

The main goal of the **Sprint Planning** is to decide your **Sprint goal**. Your **Sprint goal** is what you want to make at the end of the sprint (=**iteration**). The result of your sprint is usually called **increment**.

Usually, a sprint lasts **2 to 4 weeks**. Once you picked a duration, you shouldn't change it (unless you got a good reason).
