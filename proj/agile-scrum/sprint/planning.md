# Sprint Planning

[Go back](..)

The main goal of the **Sprint Planning**
is to decide your **Sprint goal**.
Your **Sprint goal** is what you want to make at 
the end of the sprint (=iteration).
The result of your sprint is usually called **increment**.

Usually, a sprint lasts **4 weeks**.

In the Sprint planning, you must decide
the functionalities that must be coded to fulfill
your sprint goal. To be exact, you need to split a
functionality in a list of things to do such as this 
dumb example

The client requested a frame for a desktop application

* make the frame without content
* make the toolbar
* make the screen XXX of the frame (ex: Login's screen, ...)
* deal with the translations
* make the app responsive (your app is adapting itself to the size of the screen)
* ...

And if a task is too long, split it again, 
until each task can be done in some hours.

You will manage all of these tasks in your **Sprint backlog**
(see next page).

## Evaluates the time

Sometimes, we are adding the time needed to do a task on it. 
A little game you could do, 
is to ask everyone to write on a paper
how much time they think a task will take, then the
average/median value may be used as an answer.

We usually have a list of values they may pick, 
which may look like this one

* 0
* 1/2
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 5
* 8
* 13
* 20
* 40
* 100
* ?
* inf.

The unit is up to your liking.

If you have a hard time giving a value, then
instead of using values, ask people to sort the tasks
because that should be easier to compare the tasks two by two.
