# Sprint Planning

[Go back](..)

The main goal of the **Sprint Planning** is to decide your **Sprint goal**. Your **Sprint goal** is what you want to make at the end of the sprint (=iteration). The result of your sprint is usually called **increment**.

Usually, a sprint lasts **2 to 4 weeks**.

You had a lot of functionalities in the **Product backlog**, and in the Sprint planning, you must decide the functionalities that must be coded to fulfill your sprint goal. Then, you need to **split each functionality in a list of small tasks** (taking a few hours, up to one day) like in this example

The functionality is to show the main page of a desktop application

* make the frame without any content (close, minimize, etc.)
* make the toolbar
* write the code to display the content of the main page
* deal with the translations
* make the app responsive (your app is adapting itself to the size of the screen)
* ...

You will manage all of these tasks in your **Sprint backlog**.

## Evaluates the time

Sometimes, we are adding the time needed to do a task on it. A little game you could do, is to ask everyone to write on a paper how much time they think a task will take, then the average/median value may be used as an answer.

We usually have a list of values they may pick, which may look like this one

* 0
* 1/2
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 5
* 8
* 13
* 20
* 40
* 100
* ?
* inf.

The unit is up to your liking.

If you have a hard time giving a value, then instead of using values, ask people to sort the tasks because that should be easier to compare the tasks two by two.
