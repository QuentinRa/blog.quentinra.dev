## Product Backlog

<details class="details-e">
<summary>You need to evaluate how much time they will take, this is called <b>grooming</b>.</summary>

You may ask everyone to write on a paper **how much complicated** they think a task is. This is easier than giving a duration, as they are comparing tasks. The average/median value may be used as an answer.

If you got outliers (`valeurs abÃ©rantes`) such as (almost) everyone gave "10", one gave "5", and one gave "20", then it would be a good idea to ask them **why** they gave this value (maybe they got trough of someone other didn't).

Usually, the list of values is fixed, and it looks like this: `0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ?, inf.`. You may also use the previous sprint as a reference.

## Scrum release planning

A **release plan** is summarizing a lot of information about a sprint, so you may use one too. This is also providing information for every sprint, the **roadmap** of your project.

* duration of a sprint
* deadlines
* budget
* sprint goal
* what's the definition of done (tests? doc? etc.)
