# Sprint Planning

[Go back](..)

The main goal is to decide your ``Sprint goal``
meaning what you want to make at the end of the sprint.
The result of your sprint is called ``increment``.

Usually, a sprint lasts ``4 weeks``.

In the Sprint planning, you must decide
the functionalities that must be coded to fulfill
your sprint goal. To be exact, you need to split a
functionality in a list of things to do such as this 
dumb example

The client requested a frame for a desktop application

* make the frame without content
* make the toolbar
* make the screen XXX
* ...

And split again, until each task can be done in some hours.

You will manage all of these tasks in your ``Sprint backlog``.

## Evaluates the time

Sometimes, we put the time needed to do a task on it. 
A little game is to ask everyone to write on a paper
how much time they think a task will take, then the
average value may be used as an answer. 

The list of values must be set, like

* 0
* 1/2
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 5
* 8
* 13
* 20
* 40
* 100
* ?
* inf.

unit is up to your liking. If you have a hard time giving a value, then
instead of using values, ask people to sort the tasks
because that should be easier to compare two by two.
