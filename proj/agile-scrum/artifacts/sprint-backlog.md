# Sprint backlog

[Go back](../index.md#1-sprint-planning)

The **Sprint backlog** is a list of tasks that the **dev team** took for the product backlog. They are the **tasks that they are planning to do** during the sprint. The tasks are **split into small tasks**, taking **a few hours and up to one day** to be **"done"**.

We are using the famous **white board**, with the following columns

* **Todo** (`À faire`): what have to be done
* **In-progress** (`En cours`): working on it
* **Tests** (`Tests`): optional, testing the product
* **Documented** (`Documentation`) :optional, working on the documentation
* **Done** (`Terminé/Fini`): done

Your goal is to move all of your cards in **Done**. You should add on each card the person that will do each task.

**You may do it online**, and if you do, we are mainly using one of these tools (all free)
