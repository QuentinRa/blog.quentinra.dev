# Sprint backlog

[Go back](../index.md#1-sprint-planning)

The **Sprint backlog** is a list of tasks that the **dev team** took for the product backlog. They are the **tasks that they are planning to do** during the sprint. The tasks are **split into small tasks**, taking **a few hours and up to one day** to be **"done"**.

The developers are taking tasks according to their **capacity**. This is the sum of the **evaluation/score** of each task you picked in the last sprint.

> **Note**: do not take too much "unknown-risk" stories. You should also take the previous sum of your estimations when picking tasks.

We are using the famous **white board**, with the following columns

* **Todo** (`À faire`): what have to be done
* **In-progress** (`En cours`): working on it
* **Review** (`revue/relecture`): optional, someone else is checking what you did
* **Tests** (`Tests`): optional, testing the product
* **Documented** (`Documentation`) :optional, working on the documentation
* **Done** (`Terminé/Fini`): done
* **Canceled/Blocked** (`Terminé/Fini`): optional, you won't continue a task, or you can't

Your goal is to move all of your cards in **Done**. You should add on each card the person that will do each task.

**You may do it online**, and if you do, we are mainly using one of these tools (all free)

* [Trello](https://trello.com/) (Atlassian/Jira)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/features/project-management) (Microsoft)
* [YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/) (JetBrains)

## Splitting a task (Example)

The functionality is to show the main page of a desktop application

* make the frame without any content (close, minimize, etc.)
* make the toolbar
* write the code to display the content of the main page
* deal with the translations
* make the app responsive (your app is adapting itself to the size of the screen)
* ...

## Scrum release planning

A **release plan** is summarizing a lot of information about a sprint, so you may use one too. This is also providing information for every sprint, the **roadmap** of your project.

* duration of a sprint
* deadlines
* budget
* sprint goal
* **Acceptance criteria**: What's the definition of done 
  * tests? (coverage? deployment to a production environment?)
  * doc?
* Guidelines/Guidance to write better code/improve quality
