# Product backlog

[Go back](../index.md#1-sprint-planning)

The **Product backlog**, is a sort of project specification (`cahier des charges`). This is a list of tasks. You must add the features that the client requested.

* Usually, they are **prioritized** (MoSCoW)
* Usually, they are sorted by **importance** (most important to less important)
* Usually, you must add the dependencies between tasks

Sometimes, the backlog may become too big, so you may remove the less important tasks, and label them as **"out of scope"** (such as the Could/Would, or tasks that do not impact the sprint goal if they are removed).

> The entries of the product backlog are also called **items**.

## Product roadmap (optional)

This is a long-term vision of the product. The product owner is giving the goals and the results we are expecting, rather than the the timeline/functionalities. This is something explaining **what** you are planning to do.

* you might set the current goals
* you might set the near-term goals
* you might set the long-term goals

Each of them are a list, ordered by decreasing priority.

Even in Agile projects, **having a long-term vision is very important**, and **this is a myth that you should only have a near-term vision**. This will help to make near-term decision that do not go against the overall vision of the project.

## Product requirements documents - PRD (optional)

They were used a lot in the Waterfall model, but now they are starting to be used in Agile projects. These are requirements that the Product Owner write with the team, and that the client agreed upon. This is mainly used as a strong confirmation of what you have to do

* goals, objectives, strategy
* features (user stories)
* behavior (user design, interactions, )

You will find a lot of **templates** and the Web. We usually have **the name of every person involved**, the **goals**, **why you added this requirement**, the **mockups** (`maquettes`), **the topics the team must thing about** (Question/Outcome), and **what they shouldn't work on**.

## User Stories and Epics

An **Epic** is a group of **(user) stories** that are "similar" <small>(ex: all stories related to the user management)</small>. A User story is text describing a task (~= requirement) from the point of view of a user. You got stories about

* **features** (functional)
* **bugs** (technical)
* **tests** (technical)
* **technical debt** (technical): this is what you have to do before starting to improve the code (refactor/create constants/normalize things/...)
* **actions** (technical): changing your way of doing things (=from a retrospective)

A user story is supposed to provide content about the task, so that you are "working with" the one that actually need it. We must know the **reason**, the **goal**, the **value**, and an **estimation** of the cost/value for the person needing this task to be done.

The usual template is `"As a <type of user>, I <want to do something/goal>, so that <a reason/benefit>."`.

> **TIP**: give colors according to the kind of stories. Or, you may give colors to epics and symbols to stories. <br>
> **Note**: You can see an epic as the result of a succession of stories, and a bunch of epics are making an initiative (omitted).
