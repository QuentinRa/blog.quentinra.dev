# Product backlog

[Go back](../index.md#1-sprint-planning)

The **Product backlog**, is a sort of project specification (`cahier des charges`). This is a list of tasks. You must add the features that the client requested.

* Usually, they are **prioritized** (MoSCoW)
* Usually, they are sorted by **importance** (most important to less important)
* Usually, you must add the dependencies between tasks

Sometimes, the backlog may become too big, so you may remove the less important tasks, and label them as **"out of scope"** (such as the Could/Would, or tasks that do not impact the sprint goal if they are removed).
