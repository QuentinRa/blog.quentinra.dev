# Agile Scrum

Agile **Scrum** (`Mêlée au rugby`) is one of the most used **Agile methodologies** (`méthodes agiles`). This is a kind of incremental method ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model)) that is repeating small cycles (**iterations**). A long time ago, the **V-Model** (`Cycle en V`) model <small>(an extension of the Waterfall model)</small> was the most used methodology. But, it **wasn't flexible**, the client often had to **wait a long time**, and the product **may not have been what he wanted**, so a lot of companies are moving to agile methodologies.

As this is an incremental method, you will add functionalities incrementally. When your iteration ended, the client check what you did, and give you feedback, so that you know what to do in the next iteration.

## Value and principles

> Everyone is teaching you these, because being Agile is a **mindset** (`état d'esprit`) 🤓, more than a methodology/model 🛠. And that's why I haven't removed this kind of content.

Agile-Scrum is based on **3 pillars** (transparency, inspection, adaptation), and **5 values**

* **Courage**: face your problems, and do what must be done, **don't hide bugs under the carpet** (`pas de 🐛 sous le tapis`)
* **Focus**: concentrate on the sprint goal
* **Commitment**: be committed to your work
* **Respect**: be respectful to others
* **Openness**: be open to changes or evolutions

Agile methodologies are based on **12 principles** and **4 values** ([principles and values (fr)](https://manifesteagile.fr/index.html), [principles (en)](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) and [values (en)](https://agilemanifesto.org/)). My summary is

* to do everything to make your client happy 😊
* allow changing the specifications  ✍️
* frequently deliver a working software 💻
* make sure that users and devs are working together 😏
* interact face-to-face 🗣️
* have a stable development speed 🧐
* always strive to do better 👌

## What's scrum

The client with interact with the **Product owner**, who will write the specifications of the product in the **product backlog**. You will have to take some of the functionalities and try to make a sample of the project. Then, you will demonstrate what you made to the client, and improve the **product backlog** until the client is satisfied.

The cycle of taking functionalities, coding, demonstrating, and updating the product backlog is called a **sprint**.

The team is made of 

* **Product Owner**: [interact with the client, redact the product backlog](roles/po.md)
* **Scrum master**: [overview that Scrum is correctly used/applied](roles/sm.md)
* **Dev team**: a team of usually 3 to 9 peoples

A **sprint** is considered as a project as a whole, meaning that you have to write specifications in the **sprint backlog**, code them, and test them. You will do the same as you are doing for the project and add functionalities one after another until you reach your goal, called **sprint goal**. A sprint is made of **ceremonies** (`rituels`)

1. [Sprint Planning](sprint/planning.md) <small>(What we will do?)</small>
2. [Daily Scrum](sprint/daily.md) <small>(Daily meeting)</small>
3. [Sprint review](sprint/review.md) <small>(review, demonstration, at the end)</small>
4. [Sprint retrospective](sprint/retrospective.md) <small>(suggestions for next print?)</small>

> Don't forget to write **tests**, and your **documentation**, either during or at the end of the sprint.
