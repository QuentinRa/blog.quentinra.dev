# Agile Scrum

Agile **Scrum** (`Mêlée au rugby`) is one of the most used **Agile methodologies** (`méthodes agiles`). This is a kind of incremental method ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model)) that is repeating small cycles (**iterations**). A long time ago, the **V-Model** (`Cycle en V`) model <small>(an extension of the Waterfall model)</small> was the most used methodology. But, it **wasn't flexible**, the client often had to **wait a long time**, and the product **may not have been what he wanted**, so a lot of companies are moving to agile methodologies.

As this is an incremental method, you will add functionalities incrementally. When your iteration ended, the client check what you did, and give you feedback, so that you know what to do in the next iteration.

## Value and principles

> Everyone is teaching you these, because being Agile is a **mindset** (`état d'esprit`) 🤓, more than a methodology/model 🛠. And that's why I haven't removed this kind of content.

Agile-Scrum is based on 5 **values**

* **Courage**: face your problems, and do what must be done, **don't hide bugs under the carpet** (`pas de 🐛 sous le tapis`)
* **Focus**: concentrate on the sprint goal
* **Commitment**: be committed to your work
* **Respect**: be respectful to others
* **Openness**: be open to changes or evolutions

Agile methodologies are based on **12 principles** and **4 values** ([principles and values (fr)](https://manifesteagile.fr/index.html), [principles (en)](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) and [values (en)](https://agilemanifesto.org/)). My summary is

* to do everything to make your client happy 😊
* allow changing the specifications  ✍️
* frequently deliver a working software 💻
* make sure that users and devs are working together 😏
* interact face-to-face 🗣️
* have a stable development speed 🧐
* always strive to do better 👌
