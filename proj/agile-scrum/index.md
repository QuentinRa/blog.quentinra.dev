# Agile Scrum

Agile Scrum is an agile method that may be used
for conducting a project.

The client will give you some specifications,
called **product backlog**, to the one that will
interact with him, called **product owner**. Your goal
with be to create from these specifications the minimum to
have a project that is working.

Once you have that, you will demonstrate your product
in front of the client, 
who will update the **product backlog**
to request some changes since he may have changed his
mind. Then you start again another cycle to implements
some requested functionalities until the last demonstration
where the client is satisfied. Each one of these iterations
is called a **sprint**.

A **sprint** is considered as a project as a whole, meaning
you would do your specifications, code, and test them.
You will do the same as you are doing for the project 
and add functionalities one after another until you reach
your **goal**.

## Requirements

You would usually need

* **Product Owner**: interact with the client
* **Scrum master**: overview that Scrum is correctly used/applied
* **Dev team**: a team of usually 3 to 9 peoples
* Your [scrum guide](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

First, the **Product Owner** write the specifications of the client
called [Product Backlog](product-backlog.md).
Then you will repeat a ``Sprint`` meaning all
of these steps until the end of the project

1. [Sprint Planning](sprint/planning.md) <span class="tms">(What we will do ? )</span>
2. [Sprint Backlog](sprint/backlog.md) <span class="tms">(Who will do what ?)</span>
3. [Daily Scrum](sprint/daily.md) <span class="tms">(daily meeting)</span>
4. [Sprint review](sprint/review.md) <span class="tms">(review, demonstration, at the end)</span>
5. [Sprint retrospective](sprint/retrospective.md) <span class="tms">(suggestions for next print?)</span>

## Scrum master or ideology

Agile-Scrum is based on 5 values

* **Courage**: face your problems, and do what must be done
* **Focus**: concentrate on the sprint goal
* **Commitment**: be committed to your work
* **Respect**: be respectful to others
* **Openness**: be open to changes or evolutions

You must

* do everything to make your client happy üòä
* allow changing the specifications  ‚úçÔ∏è
* frequently deliver a working software üíª
* make sure that users and devs are working together üòè
* interact face-to-face üó£Ô∏è
* have a stable development speed üßê
* always strive to do better üëå

## Some advice

Try to relay as much as possible information in your group. Be sure to ask others

* what they are doing or
* what they will do or
* what they want to do

and try to give them advice, be it person-to-person 
or talk about it, and ask for everyone's help in the **daily scrum**.

**Why?**

By asking them what they are doing,
even if they are doing fine,
you may help them get new ideas and improve their skills.
It will broaden their horizons, and yours too,
since you both see how the other one would tackle a problem.

By asking them what they will do, you will check
with them that you have the same understanding of
what they need to do and how they could tackle this.
You can give them tips/advice or help them
sail easier in their task.

Finally, you should ask each person what they want to do,
because when someone isn't motivated, then you have to
redo their work, they may create bugs and slow down
everything. You must give them tasks that they will
enjoy and do their best to make.
