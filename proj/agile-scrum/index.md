# Agile Scrum

Agile scrum is a agile method a conducting a project.

The client will give you some specifications,
called **product backlog** to the one that will
interact with him called **product owner**. Your goal
with be to create from theses specs the minimum to
have a project that is working.

Once you have that, you will demonstrate in front of
the client, who will update the **product backlog**
to request some changes since he may have changed his
mind. Then you start again another cycle to implements
some functionalities requested until the last demonstration
where the client is satisfied. Each one of theses iterations
is called a **sprint**.

A **sprint** is a treated as a project as a whole, meaning
you would do your specs, code and test it. You will do the same
as for the project in your **sprint** and add a functionality
then another etc. until you caught your **goal**.

## Requirements

You would usually need

* **Product Owner** : the only one interacting with the client
* **Scrum master** : make sure that scrum is applied correctly
* **Dev team** : a team of usually 3 to 9 peoples
* Your [scrum guide](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

First, the **Product Owner** write the specifications of the client
called [Product Backlog](product-backlog.md).
Then you will repeat a ``Sprint`` meaning all
of theses steps until the end of the project

1. [Sprint Planning](sprint/planning.md) <span class="tms">(What we will do ? )</span>
2. [Sprint Backlog](sprint/backlog.md) <span class="tms">(Who will do what ?)</span>
3. [daily Scrum](sprint/daily.md) <span class="tms">(daily meeting)</span>
4. [Sprint review](sprint/review.md) <span class="tms">(review, demonstration, at the end)</span>
5. [Sprint retrospective](sprint/retrospective.md) <span class="tms">(suggestions for next print?)</span>

## Some advices

Try to relay as much as possible information in your group. Be sure to ask others

* what they are doing or
* what they will do or
* what they want to do

and try to give them advices, be it person-to-person or talk about it and ask
for everyone help in the ``daily scrum``.
