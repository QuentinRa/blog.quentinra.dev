# Agile Scrum

Agile **Scrum** (`M√™l√©e au rugby`) is one of the most used **Agile methodologies** (`m√©thodes agiles`). This is a kind of incremental method ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model)) that is repeating small cycles (**iterations**). A long time ago, the **V-Model** (`Cycle en V`) model <small>(an extension of the Waterfall model)</small> was the most used methodology. But, it **wasn't flexible**, the client often had to **wait a long time**, and the product **may not have been what he wanted**, so a lot of companies are moving to Agile methodologies.

As this is an incremental method, you will add functionalities incrementally. When your iteration ended, the client will check what you did, give you feedback, so that you know what to do in the next iteration.

## Values and principles

> Everyone is teaching you these, because being **Agile** is a **mindset** (`√©tat d'esprit`) ü§ì, and **Scrum** a framework (`cadre de travail`~=methodology) üõ†. You need to learn both üöÄ.

Agile-Scrum is based on **3 pillars** (transparency, inspection, adaptation), and **5 values**

* **Courage**: face your problems, and do what must be done, **don't hide bugs under the carpet** (`pas de üêõ sous le tapis`)
* **Focus**: concentrate on the sprint goal
* **Commitment**: be committed to your work
* **Respect**: be respectful to others
* **Openness**: be open to changes or evolutions

Agile methodologies are based on **12 principles** and **4 values** ([principles and values (fr)](https://manifesteagile.fr/index.html), [principles (en)](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) and [values (en)](https://agilemanifesto.org/)). My summary is

* to do everything to make your client happy üòä
* allow changing the specifications  ‚úçÔ∏è
* frequently deliver a working software üíª
* make sure that users and devs are working together üòè
* interact face-to-face üó£Ô∏è
* have a stable development speed üßê
* always strive to do better üëå

## Roles

Scrum is involving **3 roles** in a team

### Product Owner

...

### Scrum master

* **"timeboxing"**: overview that a meeting to **not** last more that it was supposed to

### Dev team

...

## Scrum

The development is made of iterations, a repetition of cycles, called **sprints** (=**iteration**). The result of your sprint is usually called **increment**. A sprint is made of **4 ceremonies** (`rituels`).

1. **Sprint Planning**: when starting
2. **Daily Scrum**: meeting everyday
3. **Sprint review**: at the end, demonstration to the client
4. **Sprint retrospective**: usually at the end, look for improvements

Usually, a sprint lasts **2 to 4 weeks**. Once you picked a duration, you shouldn't change it (unless you got a good reason).

<hr class="sr">

## 1. Sprint Planning

The main goal of the **Sprint Planning** is to decide your **Sprint goal**. Your **Sprint goal** is what you want to make at the end of the sprint.

* **Involves**: PO, SM, Devs
* **Duration**: up to 4 hours/4 weeks

The Product Owner is **proposing a goal**, and the **items** of the **product backlog** that you may do.  The dev team is picking items (=>value for the client, effort), explicitly defining when they are considered to be "done" (doc? tests?), in the **sprint backlog**. You need to have a clear idea of **what makes the sprint successful**, and how you will achieve the **sprint goal**.

Your **two artifacts**

* [Product backlog](artifacts/product-backlog.md)
* [Sprint backlog](artifacts/sprint-backlog.md)

## 2. Daily Scrum or standup/stand-up

* **Involves**: PO, SM, Devs
* **Duration**: up to **15 minutes**

Check the progress. What each one did yesterday, what are they planning to do today. Identify blockers and challenges. The purpose is **informative**, a sort of coffee break üçµ (`pause caf√©`). If you don't drink coffee, maybe chatting while playing a game might be a new way of approaching this (ball ‚öæ, cards üÉè, etc.)

> **As a Scrum master**: Try to relay as much as possible information in your group. It may be a good idea to have one-to-one talk with everyone, once a day. This may help them think of new way of doing something, help them writing documentation/thinking a new tests, and broaden their horizons (and yours too).

### 3. Sprint review

* **Involves**: PO, SM, Devs, the client/users
* **Duration**: up to 4 hours/4 weeks

At the end, you must **demonstrate** to the client (and your team sometimes) what you did, the items you completed. Take note of what the client wants to change in the **product backlog**.

<hr class="sl">

### 4. Sprint retrospective

* **Involves**: PO, SM, Devs
* **Duration**: up to 3 hours/4 weeks

At the end, identify the areas of improvement. Find **what didn't work well** and of course **what worked well**.

* tools (`outils/logiciels`)
* peoples
* directives (`r√®gles: √©criture du code, comportement, etc.`)
* processes (`organisation`)
* ...

At the end, you must select **one thing** and focus on it. Focusing on one is making sure that I least one thing will improve per sprint. You might write an **action plan** of what to do.

**Note**: You can do this retrospective in the middle of a sprint.
