# Product Backlog

[Go back](index.md)

This is a list of what the client wants. You must
filter it by priorities, most likely using
``MoSCoW`` notation.

* ``M`` : Must have this
* ``S`` : Should have this
* ``C`` : Could have this
* ``W`` : Would have this

M being the task that the dev team must absolutely do. You
may ask the client about it and/or deduct it by yourself
since some tasks that the client wants may too hard/useless
if done for the first increment.

**Note** : the product Owner must verify that what
the devs coded is what the client asked.
