# Product Backlog

[Go back](index.md)

This is a list of what the client wants. You must filter it by priorities, most likely using `MoSCoW` notation.

* `M`: Must have this
* `S`: Should have this
* `C`: Could have this
* `W`: Would have this

`M` are the tasks that the dev team must do. You may ask the client about it and/or deduct it by yourself, since some tasks that the client wants may be too hard/useless if done in the first increment.

**Note** : the product Owner must verify that what the devs coded is what the client asked.
