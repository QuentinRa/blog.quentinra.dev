# HMI

Human-machines interfaces are the interfaces
that the final user will use to use a program,
website, ...

You must think a lot about how you should create one,
and that's the purpose of this course.

## Introduction

You will need

* to think about where you put the elements
of your interfaces, by creating ``wireframes``
* you would need to think about what elements
do you need in your interfaces
* you must think about how to sort things like
menus to make them simple and intuitive
  
A wireframe is literally a frame of your application,
you can draw it by yourself or use tools like

* powerpoint
* [diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net/)
* [sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) (macOS)
* Photoshop (paid)
* Justinmind (trial available but paid, the best of all)
* [moqups](https://moqups.com/) (best for free, account required)
* or simply in HTML using Boostrap, simple and efficient

You can use this great website to think about menus
or make optimal choices : [optimalworkshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/).
