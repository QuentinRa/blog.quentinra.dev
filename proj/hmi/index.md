# HMI

Human-machines interfaces are the interfaces
that the final user will use to use a program,
website, ...

You must think a lot about how you should create one,
and that's the purpose of this course.

## Introduction

You will need

* to think about where you put the elements
of your interfaces, by creating ``wireframes``
* you would need to think about what elements
do you need in your interfaces
* you must think about how to sort things like
menus to make them simple and intuitive
  
A wireframe is literally a frame of your application,
you can draw it by yourself or use tools like

* powerpoint
* [diagrams](https://app.diagrams.net/)
* [sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) (macOS)
* Photoshop (paid)
* Justinmind (trial available but paid, the best of all)
* [moqups](https://moqups.com/) (best for free, account required)
* or simply in HTML using Boostrap, simple and efficient

You can use this great website to think about menus
or make optimal choices : [optimalworkshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/).

## Users

Before coding some application, one must think about the
future users

* lang/country
* age
* colour-blind, partially sighted ...
* culture
* devices (computer ? keyboard ? mouse ?)
* screen orientation, size on tablet/phone
* day/night mode
* knowledge about computer/...
* illiterate ?

You can't make something that would be perfect and good for everyone
but try to make some categories of users and provide them
an application that would aim to satisfy most of their
requests.

## Steps

1. create some categories of users
2. ask some real persons matching your categories
where they would go to find XXX in the menus, ...
in order to test your interface.
3. create some ``UML`` diagrams to formalize
the interactions between the application and users
4. make a static mockup
5. test your mockup
6. make a dynamic mockup (links working, some code, ...)
7. test again

OR you can follows theses steps

1. categories of users / tests on some users
2. create a dynamic mockup
3. and repeat theses steps

    1. test and reviews by users
    2. filter changes to be made 
    3. implement one or more changes
