# Daily scrum

[Go back](..)

This is a **15 minutes** meeting/reunion, no more. You may skip these meetings in small teams, or not do them daily but weekly.

If you are seriously trying to do it, then do it really: you must prepare something like the daily order, or ask each person about what they will do today. Try to do it in a way that will help, and not just because you are practicing **Scrum**.

You must use these reunions to assert that everyone knows perfectly what they have to do and won't code something that was not requested.
