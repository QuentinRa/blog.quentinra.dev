# Sprint backlog

[Go back](..)

It's usually a board with post-its. We have 3 columns (todo, in-progress, and done), and we are moving the post-its/cards from one column to another. You may do it online, and if you do, we are mainly using one of these tools (all free)

* [Trello](https://trello.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/features/project-management)
* [YouTrack (JetBrains)](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/)

We will have three columns

* **Todo**: what have to be done
* **In-progress**: working on it
* **Done**: done

You will aim to move all of your cards in **Done**.

You had a lot of functionalities in the **Product backlog**, and in the Sprint planning, you must decide the functionalities that must be coded to fulfill your sprint goal. Then, you need to **split each functionality in a list of small tasks** (taking a few hours, up to one day) like in this example

The functionality is to show the main page of a desktop application

* make the frame without any content (close, minimize, etc.)
* make the toolbar
* write the code to display the content of the main page
* deal with the translations
* make the app responsive (your app is adapting itself to the size of the screen)
* ...

You will manage all of these tasks in your **Sprint backlog**.

## Evaluates the time

Sometimes, we are adding the time needed to do a task on it. A little game you could do, is to ask everyone to write on a paper how much time they think a task will take, then the average/median value may be used as an answer.

We usually have a list of values they may pick, which may look like this one

* 0
* 1/2
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 5
* 8
* 13
* 20
* 40
* 100
* ?
* inf.

If you have a hard time giving a value, then instead of using values, ask people to sort the tasks because that should be easier to compare the tasks two by two.
