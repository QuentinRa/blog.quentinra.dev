# Agile Scrum

Agile Scrum is an agile method that may be used for conducting a project. This is one of the most well-known alternatives to the traditional V-Model.

The client will give you some specifications, called **product backlog**, to the one that will interact with him, called **product owner**. Your goal will be to create from these specifications the minimum to have a project that is working.

Once you have that, you will demonstrate your product in front of the client, who will update the **product backlog** to request some changes since he may have changed his mind. Then you start again another cycle to implements some requested functionalities until the last demonstration where the client is satisfied. Each one of these iterations is called a **sprint**.

A **sprint** is considered as a project as a whole, meaning you would do your specifications, code, and test them. You will do the same as you are doing for the project and add functionalities one after another until you reach your **goal**.
