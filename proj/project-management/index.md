# What's in this course

Honestly, this is a boring theoretical yet interesting
course. You will learn a lot of things, but they may
be a lot of vocabulary. I will try to make things in an
useful way so that you will like it.

* Write Specifications (CDC)
* Project Structure
* Manage a team
* Reporting

## Vocabulary (words are in french)

* ``Besoin`` : what the client wants
* ``Livrables`` : what you will give to the client
* ``Jalons`` : important dates of your project
* ``Périmètre`` : tasks, livrables, budget, ... everything
related to the project.
* ``HJ`` : "Homme-Jour", an indicator of how many resource
a task will require
* ``Maitre d’ouvrage`` : interactions with the client
* ``Maitre d’oeuvre`` : interactions with programmers/technical staff

## Project Structure

There are usually 2 teams

* ``build-team`` or `project-team` : create the first version
* ``run-team`` or `exploitation-team` : keep the project
running, make upgrades, ...

It's usually like this.

## Specifications

You will need to write a document (Cahier des charges
in French) after thinking a lot about a lot of things.

**... Specifications**

Make a list of all tasks. You need for each task

* amount of time (HJ) and money
* a priority, see [MoSCoW](tools/moscow.md)
* maybe a mockup so that you can help
the devs know exactly what they need to do
* write some sentences about what each task
will involve (ex: register means sending a mail...
but we may not see that on the mockup so write
it). Still do not write too much, we don't like boring
stuffs.
* you can make a group of task to sort them
* you should write the POC (proof of concept)
meaning you should check if something can be done!
sometimes you client will request something that can't
be done either because of time, knowledge, technology,
man power or costs.

**Technical specifications**

* methods : Agile-Scrum, Kanban, ... ?
* tools
    * software: ???
    * os: ???
    * version (that may be important)
