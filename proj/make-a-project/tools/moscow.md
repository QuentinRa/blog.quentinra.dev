# MoSCoW

We usually use **MoSCoW** notation to sort the task by priority. We are giving one of those letters to know what must be done first and what we should do only if we have time.

* <kbd>M</kbd>: Must have this
* <kbd>S</kbd>: Should have this
* <kbd>C</kbd>: Could have this
* <kbd>W</kbd>: Would have this
