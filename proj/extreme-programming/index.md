# Introduction

There a quite a lot of extremes programming methods, but
not all we be in this course

* SOLID, KISS, DRY, ... are in [Code guidelines](../guidelines/index.md)
* Test-driven, Behaviour-driven are in [Tests](../tests/index.md)
* Design patterns are in [Design patterns](../design-patterns/index.md)
but they may not be considered a part of extremes programming

In this course, we will introduce other extremes programming methods
like the Pair-programming or Model-driven programming.
