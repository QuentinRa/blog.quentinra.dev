# Introduction

There a quite a lot of extremes programming methods, but
not all we be in this course

* SOLID, KISS, DRY, ... are in [Code guidelines](../guidelines/index.md)
* Test-driven, Behaviour-driven are in [Tests](../tests/index.md)
* Design patterns are in [Design patterns](../design-patterns/index.md)
but they may not be considered a part of extremes programming

In this course, we will introduce other extremes programming methods
like the Pair-programming or Model-driven programming.

## Pair-programming

The simplest extreme method. It's usually used in
agile-projects. 

> Two persons and one computer, one code, while the
> other
> 
> * gives advices (help, improvements)
> * ask for explications about what's this part
>   of code is supposed to do (hint to add comments)
> * think about problems that may arise (like wrong
>   arguments or usages, ....)

The two should switch-roles at least once in a while. This
will help writing better code, maybe faster since "4
eyes are better than two". It quite useful to train
a new developers so I'm practicing that a lot when
starting a project with a less experienced developer
to make sure that they don't waste time on useless
stuff and increase their skills faster.
