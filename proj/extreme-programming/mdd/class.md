# Class diagram

[Go back](..)

Create a **class diagram** of your application. You
may only write the classes names first, maybe some
attributes/methods and come back after creating some
**sequences diagrams**.

The relations between classes are the representation
of the references. If ``A`` got a reference to an instance
of ``B`` then we have `A -> B` (and you may write the
instance name).

> **Side note**: I'm enjoying use different colors for the different
> kind of classes like the classes of the VIEW, the MODEL
> and the CONTROLLER (and maybe one too for the events
> if I'm in the mood).
