# Papyrus

[Go back](../index.md)

**Papyrus** is an open-source tool, made by the eclipse foundation,
allowing you to **create** UML diagram and **simulate** them
with some data that you are providing.
You can [download it here](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/download.html). Note that the current version is **5.0.0**, but it is [models generated with the previous version should work](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mdt.papyrus/releases/5.0.0/plan).

Once the software is started, create a **new papyrus model**. A model is made of 3 files (.di/.notation/.uml), don't share only one of them, it won't work. Also, just in case, **save your model often ðŸ˜–**.

## Perspectives

First, there is a lot of perspectives <small>(way to see your project? such as Java or Papyrus (UML))</small>. Ensure that you are using the Papyrus perspective when you are creating models.

<div class="text-center">

![Papyrus perspective](images/perp1.png) and select ![Papyrus select perspective](images/perp2.png)
</div>

If you used a perspective at least once, a shortcut will be available right next to the open perspective menu. You can also use "Window > Perspective".

## Interface

<div class="overflow-auto mb-3" style="max-height: 400px;">

![Papyrus (eclipse) editor](images/editor.png)
</div>

1. **Project explorer**: Double click on a model to open it
   * export your diagrams (right-click on model -> export)
   * open your project in the file explorer (right-click on the folder "example" and "show in")
2. **Model explorer**: Once you opened a model, you can add diagrams inside it using the Model explorer: right-click on "example" > "New diagram"
3. **Model editor**: edit your diagram here: move things from the palette to here
4. **Palette**: Everything that you can put in this kind of diagram
5. **Property view**: Edit the properties of something
   * ex: give another name to a class
   * ex: give a type to an attribute
   * ex: write some documentation
   * etc.
6. **Outline view**: You can move faster using the Outline tab
   * you can see your diagram from after
   * you can change the outline view and see your diagram as a tree

## My notes

* **Don't scroll** (when editing something)

You can scroll to change the values of a field (such as checked -> uncheck, or the type of your attribute, etc.) when you are in the **Property view**. Too bad ðŸ˜‚, you can't control it and might change something/cancel everything you did.

* **Use icons**

If you are like me, and you find it tiring to scroll in the Palette from class to property and back to class... You can change the layout of the Palette.

<div class="text-center">

![palette use icons](images/icons.png) and if you forgot, you can switch back or hover the icon ![hover palette](images/icons_hover.png)

</div>

* **Window > Preferences**

If you were looking for the settings (dark mode? but it sucks), or you might change the CSS theme used in the Model editor in "Papyrus > CSS Theme".

* **State**

This is really easy to notice, but you got a little start (as usual) to indicate if you saved or not ![Papyrus saved](images/saved.png).

* **View and model**

Beware! The Model explorer is the only thing you can trust. If the view changed, but the model didn't, then this is a "bug". If this happened to you, check that you are doing what you wanted as Papyrus is expecting you to do it (ex: renaming, etc.). You can hide things from the view too, but they will still be in the model.

* **Click-click** ðŸš¬

If you want to create a bunch of things. Instead of dragging and dropping them inside the Model editor. Simply double-click on it! Each time you do so, a new element is created.

* **Align**

Either by using this icon ![Align classes](images/align.png) or <kbd>CTRL+{some arrow}</kbd>, **after selecting elements**, you can align every class based on the position of the last selected classes. This is a bit hard to use from my point of view. You can use "distribute" too.

## Knowledge-related stuff

* **Model** ðŸ‘§ðŸ‘¦

The model is something shared between every diagram. You can move something from the model to another diagram. If you change the model, it will be changed everywhere.

## Class diagrams

* **Creating undirected associations** ã€°

When selecting an association, the directed one is shown by default, but after clicking on the undirected one, it will switch

![associations](images/associations.png)

* **Special associations**

If you want to make a class that is implementing an interface (=**realizing** an interface), then the head of the arrow is on the interface.

Same for a class extending another class (=**generalization**), the head of the arrow is on the class we are extending.

* **Easily create associations** ðŸš€

Near the corners of a class, if you wait a bit while your mouse is on a class, this shortcut to create associations will appear

![associations shortcut papyrus](images/associations_shortcut.png)

* **Types**

Ex: For an attribute, you got a field "Type" inside the UML tab, when you clicked on it. Click on "... > Tree > EPackage Primitive Types" and select your type.

![Set type Papyrus](images/type.png)

> **Note**: "Boolean [1]" after the type mean that the **cardinality** is **1** (=this is a value, more than 1 means this is an array/a list/a queue/...).<br>
> **Note**: You could drag and drop a class inside the field, instead of picking a primitive type.<br>
> **Note**: if you need to create a new type, use either `DataType` (cannot be instanced) or `Primitive type` or a class if none are what you want.

* **Right-click**

If you right-click on a class/anything, you got a menu. Check **Format** if you want to reformat what you selected, and check **Filter** to show/hide operations/methods/...

* **Colors**

Add a color to your classes! We are usually using a color for the classes of the model, another for the classes of the view, another for the controllers, maybe one for the listeners too.
