# break fragment

[Go back](../index.md)

You can use the fragment "break", to interrupt the execution of the block, or the program if this is the last block.

This fragment 

* is taking a guard (like for alt/opt)
* and if the condition inside the guard is true 
* then the method, and the block, is interrupted.
