# Sequence diagram

[Go back](../index.md)

This diagram is a representation of an execution of the
program. You will have the timelines of your objects
and add the methods called and the arguments.

Usually, this diagram is made of

* a synopsis
* the diagram itself which can be either
  * SSD=System sequence diagram /``Diagramme Séquence système``
  * ??? /``Diagramme Séquence détaillé``

## Synopsis

This is a short story about what the diagram
will modelize. It's

* **short**: 3 to 5 sentences
* **instanced**: do not write "An User ..." but "Mickael ..."
* **easy to understand**:
    * only 3 to 5 use cases*
    * can be understood by a non-computer scientist

(*) If you don't know what are "use cases" then you MUST
check the UML diagram "use case diagram" since you will
select some use cases and show how they are called
inside the sequence diagram.
