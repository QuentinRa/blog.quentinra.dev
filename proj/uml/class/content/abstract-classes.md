# Abstract classes

[Go back](../index.md)

An abstract class is like a normal class aside

* the name of the class is in italic and/or with ``<<abstract>>`` before
* you can't call a constructor=instantiate the class, but you can write constructors
* an abstract class is allowed to have ``<<abstract>>`` methods, meaning methods that are not coded and that must be coded by the class generalizing the abstract class

It's an alternative to interfaces since you can have attributes and write constructors.
