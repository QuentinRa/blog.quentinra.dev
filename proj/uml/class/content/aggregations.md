# Aggregations

[Go back](../index.md)

An aggregation between an aggregator and an aggregated is a relationship where the aggregator is superior to the aggregated.

It's a bit hard to explain, but to put it simply, 

* when you have a relation ``1..n`` between A and B,
* and the relationship isn't equals (like A owning/using/... B) 

Then you have an aggregation.
