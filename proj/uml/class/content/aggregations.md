# Aggregations

[Go back](..)

An aggregation between an aggregator and an aggregated is a
relationship where the aggregator is the superior of
the aggregated.

It's a bit hard to explain but to put it simply, when
you have a relation ``1..n`` between A and B and
the relationship isn't equals (like A owning/using/... B)
then you have an aggregation.
