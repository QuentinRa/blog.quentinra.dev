| Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| void | nothing | 
| varchar(n) | string of size n |
|  int/number or int(n) | number, int(11) by default, int(0) = boolean, but you should write boolean instead |
| text | string |
| float or real | real | 
| string | same as text |
| boolean | same as int(0) |
| decimal(n, p) | decimal like xxx.yyy with n=length and p=count(y) |
| date, time, interval | a date like YYYY-MM-DD, a time since 1970 or a duration. |
