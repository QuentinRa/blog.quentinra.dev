# Unified Modeling Language

UML stands for **Unified Modeling Language**. This is a standardized way of writing diagrams, because a sentence may often lead to a lot of interpretations. The current standard is **UML 2.5.1** and **OCL 2.4**.

> OCL = Object Constraint Language. This is introduced in database diagrams, and this is used to add constraints (ex: age > 0) to something. You can use it in class diagrams too.

## Content

You got a lot of diagrams [listed on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_language#Graphical_types), but we will cover these

* [class diagram](class/index.md): the basic and most used one
* [object diagram](class/object.md): instance of a class diagram
* [database diagram](db/index.md): almost like a class diagram, for databases
* [sequence diagram](seq/index.md): application life-time diagram
* [use case diagram](use/index.md): application use-cases diagram
* [flow chart diagram](flow/index.md): automate of an application
* deployment diagram
