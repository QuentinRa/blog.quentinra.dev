# UML

UML stands for ``Unified Modeling Language`` and that's
a unified way of writing diagrams. You got some
alternatives like ``SysML`` but that won't be covered here.

## Content

You got a lot of graphics [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_language)
but we will cover these

* [class diagram](class/index.md) : the basic and most used one
* [database diagram](db/index.md) : some class diagram for databases
* [sequence diagram](seq/index.md) : application life-time diagram
* [use case diagram](use/index.md) : application use-cases diagram
* [flow chart diagram](flow/index.md) : automate of an application
