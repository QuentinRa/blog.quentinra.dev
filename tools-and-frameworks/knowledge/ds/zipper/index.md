# Zipper

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A zipper is a data structure that aggregates multiple data structures. It's often used where there is some concept of "focus" or "cursor". It's present in multiple functional languages such as [OCaml](/programming-languages/high-level/func/ocaml/index.md).

➡️ This is something that may be used in documents (ex: Word). Your cursor is always between two lists of characters (left and right).
