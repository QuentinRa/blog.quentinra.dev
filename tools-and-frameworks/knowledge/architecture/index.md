## Numbers üî¢

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

While systems typically offer types such as `boolean`, `integer`, `float`, and `string`, for a machine, there are usually 4 types:

* **bit**: 0 or 1. Often used for booleans.
* **byte**: 8 bits.
* **word**: width of a register. 16, 32, or 64 bits <small>(modern computers)</small>.
* **dword** (double word): usually 32 or 64 bits

Refer to the [Encoding | Binary](/tools-and-frameworks/knowledge/encoding/index.md#radix-2---) to learn more about how numbers are represented using 0 and 1.

<br>

#### Signed or unsigned?

Numbers can be signed or unsigned. If a number is signed, it means that the first bit is the sign: $0$ = positive, $1$ = negative.

Given $n$ bits, we can represent values between

* $[2^{n-1}, 2^{n-1}-1]$ for a signed number
* $[0, 2^{n} - 1]$ for an unsigned number

üëâ The position of the first bit is determined by the data type.
</div><div>

#### Endianness

Numbers are stored and read according to the endianness of the machine. For instance, given $(10)_2$

* **Big endian**: we will store/read $1$ then $0$
* **Little endian**: we will store/read $0$ then $1$

The same number could have two different values according to the endianness of the one that stored it, and the one that read it.

üëâ This does not include the sign bit whose position is fixed.

<br>

#### Arithmetic operations

Operations are between positive binaries. You will have to use the **two's complement** to use negative values in operations.

The only operation possible is the addition. `a-b` is handled as `a+(-b)`.

<details class="details-n">
<summary>Two's complement - negative numbers</summary>

The two's complement is an "upgrade" to the One's complement, which has the default of having two representations for the number zero. It's as simple as that:

* Invert all bits
* Add 1

To add 5 (101) to 5 (101), you need to do it like you would in grad school, with a carry.

* $1+1=0$ with $carry={\color{cyan}1}$
* $0+0+{\color{cyan}1}=1$ with $carry={\color{red}0}$
* $1+1+{\color{red}0}=0$ with $carry={\color{orange}1}$
* $0+0+{\color{orange}1}=1$ with $carry=0$
</div></div>
</details>

<br>

#### Problems

<p></p>

* üî• [**Overflow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow): an overflow occurs when the result of a calculation is outside the range of values that can be stored with our number of bits. An overflow is without consequences if the result is valid.

## Floating-point numbers

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

A floating-point number can be identified by the **decimal point** <small>(a.k.a. radix point)</small>, which is usually either `.` (dot), or `,` (comma).

#### Fractional part

Similarly to the scientific notation $x * 10^n$ in decimal, a computer represents a fraction part a $y * 2^m$.

‚û°Ô∏è Not every number can be written using scientific notation

* $e(a)$ extracts the digits after the radix point of $a$ <small>(ex: 1.11 $\to$ 0.11)</small>
* $a_i = \text{your_number}$
* do
    * $a_i = e(a_i) * 2$
    * $r_i = \text{if}\ a_i > 1.0\ \text{then}\ 1\ \text{else}\ 0$
* while $a_i \neq 1.0$

Then concatenate every $r_i$ to get the floating-point representation in binary. For instance, with $.75$

* $a_0 = 0.75 * 2 = 1.5$
* $r_0 = 1$
* $a_1 = 0.5 * 2 = 1.0$
* $r_1 = 1$

Giving us: $.75=(.11)\_2$.

#### Binary-coded Decimal (BCD)

Binary-coded decimal, a.k.a. decimal-coded binary (DCB), is used to store a fixed-length floating-point number. It's not used aside from in financial institutions or when we need to store monetary values, as there is **no loss of precision**, but it takes more space.

Each value is stored in 4 bits. For the fractional part, we use the method above.

In databases, we often use the type: `decimal(n,m)`. It means `n` digits, and `m` fractional part numbers.

‚û°Ô∏è In Packed BCD, we convert each block to hexadecimal, which is more space-efficient, but less usage-efficient <small>(need to unpack...)</small>.
</div><div>

#### IEEE754

[**IEEE754**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) is the norm modern computers are using to store a floating-point number. 3 integers are needed to do so:

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped border-dark table-dark">
<thead>
<tr><th></th><th>float<br>(32 bits)</th><th>double<br>(64 bits)</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr><td>

**S**: the sign, 0=positive, 1=negative
</td><td colspan="2">1 bit</td></tr>

<tr><td>

**E**: exponent bias
</td><td>8 bits</td><td>11 bits</td></tr>

<tr><td>

**M**: significand, mantissa, or coefficient
</td><td>23 bits</td><td>52 bits</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>$q = 127$</td><td>$q=1023$</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

As $5 = (101)_2$, and $.75=(.11)\_2$, we have $(5.75)\_{10}=(101.11)_2$.

You should have noticed that we have "1.M", so we have to move the radix point by **3 times** to the left, giving us $(101.11)_2 = (1.0111)_2 * 2^3$.

**Example** üî•: from a decimal to a float <small>(simple precision)</small>:

* $S = 0$, because $5$ is positive
* $E = 130$: we had to solve $E - q = 3$, with $3$ the shift amount, and $q=127$ as we are using simple precision
* $M = 0111$, as our number is $1.0111$, $M$ is the fractional part


**Example** üî•: from a float to a decimal

To find back numerical value, evaluate $(-1)^S * 1.M * 2^{E - q}$.

<br>

#### Problems

* **loss of precision** üí¶: numbers are truncated. For instance, adding a small number to a big number, may result in the same big number, unchanged <small>($a + \xi = a$)</small>.
* **not associative** üåæ: $(a+b)+c$ may not be equals to $a+(b+c)$, mostly because of truncating.
* **overflow**: same as for integers overflow.

## Strings üí¨

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

A string is an array of characters, such as `'a'`.  A string could have a fixed length, or a variable length. For the latter, we may use a null character such as `\0` to mark the end.

A character is encoded to a number following a charset, as we can only store integers. Some charsets are ASCII, UTF...

**ASCII table (7 bits)**

The ASCII table is the most well-known table. `'a'` in ASCII is the number `97`. 7 bits are not enough to store every character, so it's less used than in its prime. 

**Extended ASCII table (8 bits)**

This is an extension of the ASCII table adding 128 characters. It is NOT fixed. It means that given a character such as `130`, there is no warranty that all extended tables will have the same character for it.
</div><div>

**Unicode (UTF)**

UFT-8 and other variants are mainly used in international applications. UTF-8 characters are stored in 4 bytes.

<br>

#### Fonts

A font is a set of glyphs to render a character. Given two fonts, one could render the letter 'a' as `a` while another could render it as `+`.

<br>

#### Collation (database)

This is a set of rules defining how characters are ordered, compared, how the case is handled <small>(is it case-sensitive?)</small>, and how special characters are treated <small>(√†==a? before "a"? after "a"?)</small>.
</div></div>

## Others

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

#### Null value

There is usually a null value to indicate that something exists but is empty. In most languages, it's `NULL` or `null`.

<br>

#### Not A Number

There may be a value to indicate that a value is not a number. For instance, `1/0`. It's usually `NaN`.

<br>

#### Size

* **1 Kb** (kilobyte): $2^{10} = 1024$
* **1 Mb** (megabyte): $2^{20} = 1,048,576$
* **1 Gb** (gigabyte): $2^{30} = 1,073,741,824$
* **1 Tb** (terabyte): $2^{40} = 1,099,511,627,776$
* ...
</div><div>

#### Dates

Most dates are a number of seconds/milliseconds since a starting point/epoch. In many languages/systems, it is the **1st of January 1970**.

In some applications/systems, the number may be a number of days. To represent the time, We add a fraction of the day to the number of days. For instance, `12 h = 1/2`, so the day of epoch (`0`) at 12 h (`.5`) would be `0.5`.
