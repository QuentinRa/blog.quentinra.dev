A [here document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document), which is commonly shortened to heredoc is a multiline string literal syntax supported by multiple programming languages such as **Bash**, **PHP**, **Ruby**, etc.

It usually starts with `<<` followed by some `DELIMITER`. The string is closed when we reach the next occurrence of `DELIMITER`.
