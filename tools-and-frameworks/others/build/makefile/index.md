<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Makefile are file in which a developer define **rules** ✍️ to compile files, build an executable, and run it. 

* 📃 You define the dependencies between files
* 🚀 Only changed files and those dependent on it are recompiled
* 🏡 Users write simple commands such as `make build` <small>(no "gcc [...]")</small>
* 🌍 Commonly used to build Linux applications

Makefile are mainly used in C, while they can be for any languages, different tools such as CMake are used instead.
