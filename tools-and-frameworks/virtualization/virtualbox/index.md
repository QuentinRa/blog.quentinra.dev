# VirtualBox

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

VirtualBox is a popular free virtualization software.

* [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

‚û°Ô∏è I strongly advise using version 7+, because, as far as I'm concerned, I have less problems in the newer version.

* ‚ú® You can create shared folders between host and VM
* ‚ú® You can copy/paste to/from the VM
* üè™ You can take snapshots

## Random notes

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-3"><div>

#### Bug: no automatic mouse integration

By default, you can freely use your mouse between your host and your virtual machine. But, I had a bug ü™≤, when restarting a machine close using "save instance state", in which my mouse was not detected anymore.

‚û°Ô∏è My "patch" is to lock the VM before closing it.
</div><div>

#### Bug: bidirectional keyboard not working

‚û°Ô∏è Try restarting the VM.

#### Notes for Active Directory

‚û°Ô∏è If the VM crashes often, try reducing the size of the screen, it won't always work, but that's better than nothing.

‚û°Ô∏è The NAT adapter can mess with some things like when adding a child domain. You should disable it <small>(if applicable/temporarily)</small>.
