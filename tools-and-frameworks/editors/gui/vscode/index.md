# Visual Studio Code

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <small>(a.k.a. VSCode, VSC)</small> is a free üí∏ **text-editor** which can become as powerful as an IDE by adding extensions to it üåü.

On StackOverflow surveys, 70% of polled developers use VSC, mainly because it's free and supports many languages.

One inconvenience is that support for many languages is added through extensions. It may not be very smooth to use, or the programmer may still have a lot to do manually.
