# CMake

[Go back](../../../../_kmp/_archives/tools/jetbrains/index.md#clion)

If the name is `prim` then after compiling your CMakelist you will have here

![targets](targets.png)

and you can

1. compile
2. select this target as the compiled one/run one
3. change the profile
4. run this target

(A profile is a configuration. You may use these if you want to try to build/run using different configurations, but that should not be the case most of the time).
