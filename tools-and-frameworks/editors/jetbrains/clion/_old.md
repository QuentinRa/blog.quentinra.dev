# CLion

Examples of cases where you might be using it

* code in `C`
* code in `C++`

CLion was using **CMake** to compile your project, but since 2021.2, it's now really easy to use a **Makefile**. Still, since CMake was not that hard, I'm letting it here.

* [Starting with CMake](cmake.md)
* [Makefile project](makefile.md)
* [Set compiler](compiler.md)
* [Remote working](remote.md)
* [Debug](debug.md)
