# PHPStorm

Examples of cases where you might be using it

* code in `PHP`
* code in `HTML/CSS/JS` or `Boostrap` (but WebStorm might be wiser)
* code in `Node.js`

Please note that you can directly code on a server, which may be useful for those that were uploading their files each time they changed on a server.
