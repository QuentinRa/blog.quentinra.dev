💵 Aside from [IntelliJ IDEA](../idea/index.md) and PyCharm, all IDEs are paid.

📱 [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), by Google, is based on IntelliJ IDEA community.

🎓 Their IDEs are [free for students](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students).

🔥 You can manage all of their IDEs using the [toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

## Running some code

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There is a green play icon next to code that you can run:

![run](_images/run.png)

This will create a **Run configuration**, which is a wrapper to all information related to the execution of your program. You could add compiler option, program arguments...

You can create, edit, or select a configuration here:
