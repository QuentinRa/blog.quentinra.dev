All JetBrains IDEs share the same interface, and many common features such as:

* 🚀 Code improvement tips
* 🧼 Bugs, code smells, and typos detection
* ✨ GIT integration
* 🌍 Use of remote tools or environment
* 🗺️ UML generation for supported languages

And in each IDE, some languages, frameworks, and build tools have additional features and support.

💵 Aside from [IntelliJ IDEA](../idea/index.md) and PyCharm, all IDEs are paid.

📱 [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), by Google, is based on IntelliJ IDEA community.

🎓 Their IDEs are [free for students](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students).

🔥 You can manage all of their IDEs using the [toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).
