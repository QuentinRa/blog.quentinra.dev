You may add here tips that many people may look for, especially when this is a tip about the configuration of the IDE.

## Zoom on scroll

<kbd>Shift-Shift</kbd> then enter `mouse wheel`, click on the only suggestion (Settings > General), and check the parameter to enable resize by scrolling.

<hr class="sr">

## Add a star (*) to modified files

<kbd>Shift-Shift</kbd>, enter `mark modified`, and switch it to ``on``. You should see your little star.

<hr class="sl">

## Change proofreading language

<kbd>Shift-Shift</kbd>, then enter ``Proofreading``, and manage your languages.

<hr class="sr">

## Delete unused warnings

You may call a variable ``ignore``, sometimes (in a try-catch, for instance), JetBrains understand that you won't use this variable for a reason.

Otherwise, when you're using <kbd>alt+enter</kbd>, on each patch suggested you got a small arrow, and you may suppress the warning inside.

## Soft wraps

If a line is too long for being completely displayed on your screen, as it may happen in JSON files (since you can't make multiline), you can enable auto-wrapping

* right-click right after the line number,
* and enable soft-wrap

If you want something permanent, 

* <kbd>Shift-Shift</kbd>
* "soft wrap"
* "soft wrap these files"
* and add your file extension

## Icon for your project

You can add an icon for your project! Simply close your project, right-click on it, and "change project icon".
