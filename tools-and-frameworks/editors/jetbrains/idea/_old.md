# IntelliJ IDEA

Examples of cases where you might be using it

* code in `Java` (with or not with `Gradle` and `Maven`)
* code in `Kotlin`
* code in `R` (with a plugin)
* code in `OCaml` (with a plugin)
* code in `JavaFX` and with Scene builder

One thing to note is the menu `Project structure`(`CTRL+ALT+MAJ+S`). You can

* change your JDK
* change your module configuration (set source folder, tests folder, output folder, ...)
* add libraries (such as JUnit4, ...)

Then some tutorials

* [Run](run.md)
* [Run tests](tests.md)
