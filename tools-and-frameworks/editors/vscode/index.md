# Visual Studio Code

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <small>(a.k.a. VSCode, VSC)</small> is a free üí∏ **text-editor** which can become as powerful as an IDE by adding extensions to it üåü.

On StackOverflow surveys, VSC has usually 70% of popularity across all developers, mainly because it's free and supports many languages.

One inconvenient is that support for many languages is added through extensions. It may not be very smooth to use, or the programmer may still have a lot to do manually.
