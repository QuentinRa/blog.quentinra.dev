For games not supporting your keyword, you can temporarily use a tool to rebind your keys. It's somewhat buggy through. A tutorial can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=270957415). In short, download [GlovePIE](https://github.com/Ravbug/GlovePIE/releases/tag/Release) and bind keys.

```

Key.Z = Keyboard.W
