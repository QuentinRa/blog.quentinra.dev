# GitHub Actions

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

GitHub Actions were introduced in 2018 to design CI/CD workflow for GitHub projects. Actions are small reusable code that simplifies the process of creating a CI/CD workflow.

## Basic syntax

Workflows are defined in [YAML](/programming-languages/others/data/yaml.md) files stored in `.github/workflows/`. Their name is based on the YAML file name, e.g., `Build` for `build.yml`.

A basic Action executing `job_name` on every `push`:

```yaml!
name: Action Name

on: [push]

jobs:
  job_name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    # unnamed command
    - run: echo "Hello, World!"
    # named command
    - name: Saying Hello
      run: echo "Hello, World!"
```
</div><div>

A runner is an agent executing commands. The `runs-on` parameter designates which runner to use. You can use [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#choosing-github-hosted-runners) such as `ubuntu-latest` or `windows-latest` or use [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).

A common action is `checkout` to clone your repository:

```yaml!
    - name: Check out repository code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

For each step, you may use these optional attributes:

```
      - name: XXX
        # only execute based on a condition
        if: runner.os == 'Windows'
        # run multiple commands
        run: |
          xxx
          xxx
        env: # set an environment variable
          XXX: xxx
```
</div></div>

## Advanced syntax

#### Trigger

The [`on` keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) determines what events can trigger a workflow.

```yaml!
on:
  pull_request:         # on any pull request

on:
  push:                 # push on main
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:         # merge request on main
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:             # automatically
    - cron: '0 3 * * 5'
```
</div><div>

#### Strategy

The [`strategy` keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy) let us define variables. The job below will be executed `4` times as we have `4` values <small>(cartesian product of all variables)</small>.

```yaml!
    strategy:
      matrix:
        some_variable: [10, 11, 12, 13]

    steps:
      - name: Use Version ${{ matrix.some_variable }}
        run: echo "use version ${{ matrix.some_variable }}"

```
