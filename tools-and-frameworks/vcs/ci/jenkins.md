[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) <small>(21.2k ‚≠ê)</small> is an open-source automation server. It means that it's a server hosting code, but it's a server that can be integrated to a GIT server <small>(GitLab, GitHub...)</small> to process CI/CD workflows.

The biggest strength of Jenkins is that is has a great number of [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/), such as plugins to visualize CI results <small>(tests, coverage...)</small>.
