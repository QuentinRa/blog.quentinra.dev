# Remote Git Server features 🏹

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

#### 🏹 Issues

When someone found a bug/problem with the project, they will usually create an issue. [See GitHub tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

On GitHub/GitLab/???, you can create issue templates.

> See [GitHub Issue templates](https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates) (3.5k ⭐)

<br>

#### 🏹 Wiki

The wiki is used by developers to write some primitive documentation that is store "near" your project. You can add images inside, that are stored in your repository <small>(try with/without a leading `/`)</small>.

You can clone your wiki with `.wiki.git` instead of `.git`!

<br>

#### 🏹 Forks

Usually, repositories do not allow everyone to contribute. Instead, they can fork the repository, which will create a copy that they own. They will work on it, and they will be able to create a Pull Request to the original repository, that may be merged by the original repository's maintainers. [See GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

#### 🏹 Pull Requests (PR) / Merge requests

In most cases, developers establish a formal procedure to merge branches into main. Anyone will have to create a Pull Request asking if they can merge. Then, reviewers will check the code, and allow master/main to be modified. [See GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

On GitHub/???, you can create pull requests templates.

#### 🏹 References

I'm still not sure if this is only available on GitHub or not, but every issue/pull request as an Id, for instance, `#1`. You can reference this Id anywhere else, for instance, inside a commit! At least on GitHub, on the issue/Pull request page, we will see the referencing commit SHA1.

> On GitHub, you can also reference a user with `@username`.

## ✍️ Less commonly used features ✍️

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

#### ✍️Co-authors

*Available at least on: GitHub*

If you know someone else email, then you can include them as author of a commit. Note that the one creating the commit (you) will be marked as commiter, so there will always be at least two names, unless you directly edit the GIT configuration 🚓.

```bash
git commit -m "xxx

Co-authored-by: name <name@example.com>"
```

<br>

#### ✍ Reference code in issues

*Available at least on: GitHub*

There is a nice way of referencing code from the same repository inside an issue/a pull request. See [GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-code).

* Open the target file
* Click on the line number of the line you want to reference
* Hold Shift and press another line to select an interval
* Click on "..."
* Copy permalink
* Then simply paste the permalink inside an issue/a pull request

> It won't always work. In such cases, simply click on "..." on a file, get the permalink, and append to it `#LX` <small>(line X)</small> or `#LX-LY` <small>(line X to line Y)</small>.

</div><div>

#### ✍️CODEOWNERS

*Available at least on: GitHub, GitLab*

This file is a dictionary with patterns associated with GitHub/... usernames. Repositories can be configured so that if a file owned by a codeowner is modified, then inside the Pull Request, the CodeOwner will be asked for a review. See [GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).

```
*       @QuentinRa
```

<br>

#### ✍️Git attributes

*Available at least on: GitHub*

While the file `.gitattribute` is not exclusive to GitHub/..., it is used by GitHub [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/tree/master/docs) if we want to edit the rules that GitHub uses to determine languages used by our project.

```
# Ex: add Markdown files in the language list
*.md linguist-documentation=false linguist-detectable=true
```

<br>

#### ✍️Projects

*Available at least on: GitHub*

This is a feature that includes Agile-Scrum Scrum boards. It's actually a bit more complex and less convenient. You can create **tasks**, but you can't do much with them. Once you convert them to **issues**, you can assign people to them along with tags. They are useful to track/sort **issues** and keep track of **milestones**.
