[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a popular and widely used [version control system](../../_general/index.md) (DVCS). We create snapshots of our project called **commits** 🔐. They are stored in **branches** 🪵, which are quite similar to local copies of the project.

Git usually involves two sides:

* the **git clients** 👲: they work on the project...
* the **remote git server** 🖥: it's a hub to synchronize every client...
