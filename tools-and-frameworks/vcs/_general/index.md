# Version Control

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Version control, a.k.a. source control is a system that manages changes to files of a project over time. Version control systems (VCS) are either:

* Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) 🏭: a central server keeps track of every change <small>(ex: [SVN](../svn/_general/index.md))</small>.

* Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) 🏠: each user can keep track of every change  <small>(ex: [GIT](../git/_general/index.md), [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/))</small>.

It's quite used in software development, especially [GIT](../git/_general/index.md).

VCS addresses several challenges that arise when working on software development:

* **Tracking Changes** 🔎: who made a change? when? why?...
* **Collaboration** 🌍: handle problems when multiple persons work on the same file. Also handle problems when a copy of the project was made to test something, and we need to "merge" it.
* **Backup and Recovery** 😵: if something goes wrong such as a file or some code bing deleted, we can revert these changes.
