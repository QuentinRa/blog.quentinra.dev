## Coding Principles

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Don’t repeat yourself (DRY) 🎰

Write your code once. Don't copy and paste. Write functions. It reduces the number of locations to patch when a bug is found.

Also, avoid reusing hard-coded constants, such as `"Hello, World"`, and store them in a constant, for the same reason.

#### You ain't gonna need it (YAGNI) 🚮

Don't write code for something unless you need it **right now**. Stop writing code that will supposedly be used 'later'.

#### Keep it simple, stupid (KISS) 😘

Simple code is easier to debug and maintain. Don't make things complicated, write simple code that works.

#### Code For The Maintainer 🌍

Put yourself in the shoes of the maintainer when writing code to ensure that the code is genuinely maintainable.

#### Don't reinvent the wheel 🛞

Before creating something from scratch, try to look is there is a maintained stable solution that could start from. It reduces the code to maintain and the time it takes to get a working program.
