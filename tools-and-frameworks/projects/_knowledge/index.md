# Project Management

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

In a nutshell, a project involves:

* **Objectives** 🛣️: decipher and address client needs.
* **Deliverables** 📬: what you'll deliver to clients
* **Milestones** 📌: Key dates throughout your project timeline
* **Scope** 💵: Tasks, budget, and project-related elements
* **Resource Management** 📊: effort required for tasks (Man-days?)
</div><div>

A project usually involves two different teams:

* **Development Team** 🧑‍🔬: This is the initial group responsible for designing, coding, and implementing the project. They usually leave or move to another project after project completion.

* **Maintenance and Support Team** 🚵: This group takes over to ensure the project continued functionality, fix any issues that arise, and implement updates or improvements.
