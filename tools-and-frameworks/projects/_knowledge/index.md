# Project Management

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

In a nutshell, a project involves:

* **Objectives** 🛣️: decipher and address client needs.
* **Deliverables** 📬: what you'll deliver to clients
* **Milestones** 📌: Key dates throughout your project timeline
* **Scope** 💵: Tasks, budget, and project-related elements
* **Resource Management** 📊: effort required for tasks (Man-days?)
</div><div>

A project usually involves two different teams:

* **Development Team** 🧑‍🔬: This is the initial group responsible for designing, coding, and implementing the project. They usually leave or move to another project after project completion.

* **Maintenance and Support Team** 🚵: This group takes over to ensure the project continued functionality, fix any issues that arise, and implement updates or improvements.

## Specifications Document

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

It outlines the specifications that a project must meet. 

#### Overview

A simple specification document may include:

* **Introduce the company**: name, logo, background, etc.
* **Introduce the project**: client, needs, etc.
* **Introduce the target audience**: age, knowledge, etc.
* **Introduce the team**: members, roles, etc.
* **Introduce the graphic chart**: if you have one

#### Functional Specifications

This section focuses on the functionalities of the product. It could be a table with basic information about each task, along their priority.

| N°| Task name | Duration (days) | Man-days | Priority |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|   | Phase1 | 20 | 85 | M |
| A | Task1	 | 8 | 25 | M |
| B | Task2 | 12 | 60 | C |

We often use MosCOW to determine the priority of each task:

* <kbd>M</kbd>: Must have this
* <kbd>S</kbd>: Should have this
* <kbd>C</kbd>: Could have this
* <kbd>W</kbd>: Would have this
</div><div>

You will have to further develop each task, by describing as much as possible, what must be done.

* You could design a mockup
* Don't forget error messages, events, animations/colors such as when a button is pressed, etc.
* Describe the task from the point of a view of a user
* Define UML diagrams to formally define the task
* ...

#### Technical Specifications

The technical specifications define which languages, tools, and which technical constraints the development team will have.

* **Methods**: Agile-Scrum, Kanban, etc.
* **Technologies**
    * name (MariaDB? MySQL? Java? PHP? Etc.)
    * version (at least? Up to? Exact value?)
* **Platforms**: target platform(s)
* **Language**: French, English, etc.
* **Storage**: How do we manage persistence? (Database? File?)
* **Restrictions**: other restrictions, such as forbidding cookies.
* **Hardware**: are additional devices/components/... required?
* **Others**: version control, team communications, etc.

#### Risk Evaluation

You must evaluate the risks that may occur and determine how to handle them. It could be a person/tool/... that is not available, a task complexity that was incorrectly evaluated, a required dependency whose delivery was delayed, etc.
