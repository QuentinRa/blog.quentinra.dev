# Critical path analysis

[Go back](..#scheduling-problem)

A critical path is a path of tasks that must not be delayed, otherwise, the whole project will be delayed. You can have more than one.

* In the **P.E.R.T. method**

The arrows are linking states together, and the task is the name on the arrows. A critical path is a path in which every node has the same value for the early start and the last start. But since the name of the tasks is on the arrows, you have to replace the states with the tasks that made us enter this state.

* In the **Metra potential method**

This is a PATH made of the tasks that have the same value for the early start and the last start.
