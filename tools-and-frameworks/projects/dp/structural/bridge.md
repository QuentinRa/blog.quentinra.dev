<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Aliases** 📌: None

**Description** 📚: We are separating an object abstraction from its implementation. For instance, we would separate:

* A converter <small>(from X to Y)</small> from how we convert something
* A figure <small>(Circle, Square)</small> from how we render it
* ...

Basically, we interact with interfaces rather than concrete classes.
