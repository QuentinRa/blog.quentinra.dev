# Design Patterns

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Design patterns are typical solutions used to solve recurring problems in software design 🌺. The initiative was started by the **Gang Of Four**. It was completed [GRASP patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)) and [Anti-Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern).

There are 4 great categories of design patterns:

* **Creational** 📚: how to create objects
* **Structural** 🗃️: how to structure your code
* **Behavioral** 📮: how to make the interactions between objects
* **Architectural** 🏘️: how to think your code

#### Creational 📚

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms. It's assumed you already know about [objects and classes](/programming-languages/_paradigm/oo.md#classes-and-objects).
