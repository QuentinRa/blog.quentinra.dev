# Design Patterns

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Design patterns are typical solutions used to solve recurring problems in software design 🌺. The initiative was started by the **Gang Of Four**. It was completed [GRASP patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)) and [Anti-Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern).

There are 4 great categories of design patterns:

* **Creational** 📚: how to create objects
* **Structural** 🗃️: how to structure your code
* **Behavioral** 📮: how to make the interactions between objects
* **Architectural** 🏘️: how to think your code

## Common Design Patterns

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Creational 📚

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms. It's assumed you already know about [objects and classes](/programming-languages/_paradigm/oo.md#classes-and-objects).

* [Factory](creational/factory.md): control how/which instances are created
* [AbstractFactory](creational/abstract.md): control how/which factories are created
* [Singleton](creational/singleton.md): only allow one instance of a class <small>(at a time)</small>
* [Multiton](creational/multiton.md): only allow n instances of a class at a time
* [Prototype](creational/prototype.md): xxx
* [Builder](creational/builder.md): xxx
* [Object Pool](creational/object-pool.md): xxx
