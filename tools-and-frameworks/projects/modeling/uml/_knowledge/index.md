[Unified Modeling Language (UML)](https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/) is a standardized visual modeling language used to both to **design** ‚úçÔ∏è and **document** üìù systems.

We use it to create diagrams for our software and their components.

The current standard is **UML 2.5.1** (2017).

There are several types of [UML diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language#Diagrams):

* [Class Diagram](../diagrams/class/index.md): model the classes/attributes/methods/...
* [Use Case Diagram](../diagrams/use_case/index.md): model the use cases of the system
* [Sequence Diagram](../diagrams/sequence/index.md): model the interactions between components
* [Activity Diagram](../diagrams/activity/index.md): model the flow of actions and operations
* [Object Diagram](../diagrams/object/index.md): model an instance of a class diagram
* ...
