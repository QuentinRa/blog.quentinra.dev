[Unified Modeling Language (UML)](https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/) is a standardized visual modeling language used to both to **design** ✍️ and **document** 📝 systems.

* [Sequence Diagram](): model the interactions between components
* [Activity Diagram](): model the flow of actions and operations
* [Object Diagram](../diagrams/object/index.md): model an instance of a class diagram
