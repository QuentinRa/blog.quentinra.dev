# Database Diagram

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A database diagram seems to be an unofficial diagram mostly based on a simplified [Class Diagram]() with some semantic changes.

A **class** 🗃️ such as `Person` corresponds to a database table. It has **attributes** 📚 such as `name` of type `String`.

Some attributes such as `id` are special attributes called **keys**. They are used to identify a record <small>(e.g., a person among Persons)</small>.

**Associations** 🔗, **Generalizations** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, and **multiplicity** 🔢 are the same as for classes diagrams.
