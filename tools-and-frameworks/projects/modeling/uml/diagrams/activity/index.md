# Activity Diagram

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Activity diagrams <small>(UML)</small> are often confused with Flowchart diagrams <small>(not UML nor specific to programming)</small> as they are similar 🗺️.

It represents every **state** 📍 of the program and how we **transit** ✈️ from one state to another.

For instance, in a game menu, we may have some states such as:

* MainMenu
* Load Game
* Select Character
* QuitGame

The transitions are the option we select to navigate between them.
