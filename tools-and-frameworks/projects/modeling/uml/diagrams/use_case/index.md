# Use Case Diagram

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

An Use Case Diagram is used to visualize the functionality of a **system** 🏠 <small>(ex: a restaurant)</small> from the perspective of its **actors** <small>(ex: a client)</small> 🧑.

Each of `Order`, `Checkout` and `Eat` are called **use cases** 🎫 and represent what the **actors** 🧑 can do within the **system** 🏠. The arrows between both are called **associations** 🌿.

An actor can be another system. For instance, the restaurant is interacting with providers, so we will another another diagram with "restaurant" as an actor and "Provider" as a system.

It's not a temporal diagram, e.g., it doesn't represent actions that can be performed after performing another action first.
