# Synopsis

This is a short story about what the diagram will represent. It's

* **short**: 3 to 5 sentences
* **instanced**: do not write "An User ..." but "Mickael ..."
* **easy to understand**:
    * only 3 to 5 use cases*
    * can be understood by a non-computer scientist

(*) If you don't know what are "use cases" then you MUST check the UML diagram "use case diagram" since you will select some use cases and show how they are called inside the sequence diagram.

## Sequence Fragments

In French, we call those ``Cadres dâ€™interactions``. They are allowing us to use loops, if, ... in our diagram.
