# Associations and multiplicity

Now that you can write a class, we will look at the relationships between classes, represented by what we call associations/relationships. An association is a representation of a link between two classes. We usually write a multiplicity "n..m" characterizing how many instances of the classes are linked with how many of the other classes. We are also adding a name to remember what kind of link it is.

* [Multiplicity](content/multiplicity.md)
* [association classes](content/association-classes.md)
* an association from A to A is called self-association (``association r√©flexive``)
* you can add a direction
* adding a name on the association is optional
* you can have multiples associations between 2 classes

And sometimes you may declare an attribute having the type of another class inside your diagram. Some programmers are adding the attribute **on the association** rather than **inside the class**, but not everyone does this.

## Advanced associations

You are going to use the generalization a lot to factorize your code logic, aggregation/compositions are used a lot, but they aren't really useful.

## Associations constraints

* **dynamic**: you write a note on the association, explaining the constraints (ex: you can't call buy before order)
  
The following constraints, are applied on every association **linked to a line ``------``**. We are adding the constraint on top of the line, which could be a constraint of

* **inclusion** ``{IN}, {SUBSET}, {I}``: if one association exist, then all of them exist too
* **exclusion** ``{X}``: if one association exist, then only one exist
* **equality/simultaneity** ``{=}, {AND}, {S}``: all associations must exist
* **total/coverage/inclusive** ``{T}, {OR}``: at least 1 association exist
* **partition/exclusive** ``{XT}, {P}, {+}``: only 1 association exist

For the constraint of inclusion, we are not drawing a line, but an arrow from the association X to the association Y. It means that X can only exist if Y exists.
