# Class Diagrams

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A class diagram is used to represent the structure of a system. It's mostly used for [object-oriented](/programming-languages/_paradigm/oo.md) modeling.

<div class="text-center">

![class.pu](_uml/class.svg)
</div>

It's abstract and the concrete version is called an [object diagram](../object/index.md). Creating an object from a class is called **instantiation**.
</div><div>

A **class** üè° is an abstract representation of a concept, such as a Book or a Person. Each class has:

* **attributes** üé´: these are the data properties of a class. For instance, a title.
* **operations** üè≠: these are the behaviors that concepts can perform. For instance, from a book, we can get its details <small>(using getDetails)</small>.

There are also **associations** üõ£Ô∏è which represent the relationships between concepts (e.g., classes). There are none in the example.

## Basics syntax

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

We use "member" to refer to both attributes and operations.

#### Modifiers

Each member can have a [modifier](/programming-languages/_paradigm/oo.md#access-control) <small>(explicit or not)</small> which is something to limit who can access an attribute or an operation.

* `+` is for public
* `-` is for private
* `~` is for package
* `#` is for protected

<br>

#### Class Members

Class members <small>(a.k.a. `static` members)</small> are attributes and methods that are shared across every instance.

They are commonly used for constants attributes, utilities...

In UML, such members are **underlined** üåµ.

## Overview

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

#### Classes

Classes are made both of attributes and methods separated by a line. The name of the class must always start with an uppercase.

#### Attributes

Each attribute must have at least a name and a type. It may have a modifier and a default value.

You can have OCL constraints such as `{final}` right-after the attribute.

<div class="text-center">

![attribute](_uml/attribute.svg)
</div>

* Derived attributes

Derived attributes are attributes whose values is calculated using other attributes. They are usually created for convenience.

<div class="text-center">

![derived attribute UML](_uml/derived.svg)
</div>

* Composite attributes

Composite attributes are attributes composed of multiple attributes. 

<div class="text-center">

![composite attribute UML](_uml/composite.svg)
</div>
</div><div>

#### Operations

Each attribute must have at least a name followed by parenthesis. It may have a modifier, parameters <small>(comma-separated)</small>, and a return type.

‚ö†Ô∏è No return type is NOT the same as `void`.

üìù Methods can be annotated: `<<constructor>>` or `<<destroy>>`.

## Associations and multiplicity

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Associations represent which classes are linked to which other classes.

<div class="text-center">

![association_1](_uml/association_1.svg)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
![association_2](_uml/association_2.svg)
</div>

Associations are not necessarily representing attributes while most do.

* There could be multiple associations between two classes
* You can add arrows if the association is unidirectional. By default, there is no associations meaning it's bidirectional.
* An association from the class to itself is called self association

<br>

#### Multiplicity

The multiplicity indicates how many instances of a class are associated with instances of another class.

* There are **a..b** instances of **B** associated with **A**.
* There are **c..d** instances of **A** associated with **B**.

<div class="text-center">

![association](_uml/association.svg)
</div>

<details class="details-e">
<summary>List of possible values</summary>

* <kbd>n</kbd>: same as <kbd>n..n</kbd>
* <kbd>*</kbd>: same as <kbd>0..\*</kbd>
* <kbd>0..1</kbd>: 0 or 1
* <kbd>0..*</kbd>: same as <kbd>\*</kbd>
* <kbd>1..*</kbd>: 1 or more
* <kbd>n..*</kbd>: <kbd>n</kbd> or more
* <kbd>n..m</kbd>: at least <kbd>n</kbd>, and up to <kbd>m</kbd>
* <kbd>n..n</kbd>: exactly <kbd>n</kbd>

For instance, we could replace <kbd>a..b</kbd> with <kbd>0..1</kbd> <small>(meaning 0 or 1)</small> or with <kbd>*</kbd> (0 or more).
</details>
</div><div>

#### Association classes

Association classes are used to represent a relationship with additional attributes. The name of the class is the same of the relationship.

![assos_class](_uml/assos_class.svg)

For instance, `Class1` could be a Student, `Class2` a course, and we could have an association class `Enrollment` linking the two.

<br>

#### Constraints on associations

It's possible to add constraints on associations, such as two associations being mutually exclusive <small>(e.g. can't have both)</small>.

Link two associations or more with a dotted line and add constraints on it that will be applied on all linked associations.

* **Inclusion** `{IN}/{SUBSET}/{I}`: either all associations exist or none
* **Exclusion** `{X}`: only one may exist
* **Equality/Simultaneity** ``{=}, {AND}, {S}``: all associations must exist
* **Total/Coverage/Inclusive** ``{T}, {OR}``: at least 1 association exist
* **Partition/Exclusive** ``{XT}, {P}, {+}``: only 1 association exist

For the inclusion constraint, we use an arrow instead of a dotted line. If the arrow goes from X to Y, it means that X can only exist if Y exists.

üí° You can also use this syntax to write dynamic constraints, such as `{we can't buy before ordering}`.

Packages are used to group and sort classes.
