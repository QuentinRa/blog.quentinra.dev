# Class Diagrams

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A class diagram is used to represent the structure of a system. It's mostly used for [object-oriented](/programming-languages/_paradigm/oo.md) modeling.

It's abstract and the concrete version is called an [object diagram](../object/index.md).

A **class** 🏡 is an abstract representation of a concept, such as a Book or a Person. Each class has:

* **attributes** 🎫: these are the data properties of a class. For instance, a title.
* **operations** 🏭: these are the behaviors that concepts can perform. For instance, from a book, we can get its details <small>(using getDetails)</small>.

There are also **associations** 🛣️ which represent the relationships between concepts (e.g., classes). There are none in the example.
