</div><div>

The editor is divided in five Windows.

1. **Model Explorer** 🌱: a Model is a collection of diagrams. You can reuse something from a diagram in another diagram.

2. **Working Diagrams** 📇: all recently opened diagrams

3. **Toolbox** 🪛: UML elements available for the opened diagram

4. **View** 🖼️: the opened UML diagram. Click on an element from the toolbox and click somewhere in this window to add it.

5. **Editor** 🧑‍🍳: you can manipulate UML elements properties or add additional information such as documentation.

➡️ In the Model Explorer, the "Untitled" is the project name.
