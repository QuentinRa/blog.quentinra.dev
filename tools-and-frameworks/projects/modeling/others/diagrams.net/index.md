The website [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) is a quite popular online tool to create simple and non-standardized diagrams. 

* 💵 It's free
* 🐣 It doesn't require any knowledge
* 🔑 It doesn't require any login
* 🌍 We do not have to install anything

The main disadvantage is that it's not [UML](/tools-and-frameworks/projects/modeling/uml/_knowledge/index.md) nor enforcing a standard.

Without useful and clear explanations <small>(which may be hard to do)</small>, everyone may understand your diagrams in a different way.

It's not appropriate to use this for complex diagrams.
