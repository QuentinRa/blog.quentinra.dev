The website [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) is a quite popular online tool for creating simple and non-standardized diagrams.

* 💵 It's free
* 🐣 It doesn't require much knowledge
* 🔑 It doesn't require an account
* 🌍 We do not have to install anything

The main disadvantage is that it doesn't enforce a standard <small>(ex: [UML](/tools-and-frameworks/projects/modeling/uml/_knowledge/index.md))</small>.

Without useful and clear explanations <small>(which is usually a complex task)</small>, everyone may understand your diagrams in a different way.

It's not appropriate to use this for complex diagrams.
