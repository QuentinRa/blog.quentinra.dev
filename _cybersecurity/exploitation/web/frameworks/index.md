# Frameworks

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* Look if the framework is credited at the bottom of the page
* Look if there is an HTML comment with the framework name/...
* Look for the default favicon of the framework. Usually, it's stored at `/favicon.ico`, although it's usually removed. If you do find one, download it, hash it (MD5), and [find it in OWASP favicon database](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database)

```bash
# Linux
curl url/favicon.ico | md5sum
# Windows (on a download favicon)
Get-FileHash .\favicon.ico -Algorithm MD5
```

</div><div>

If you found a framework

* Look for a way to get the version (as a client, if any). For instance, the framework in a specific version, may use a specific version of a JavaScript/CSS library, if any. It may be a hint, though it's not reliable.
* Look for common misconfiguration mistakes
* Look for vulnerabilities
* Look for the login page / CMS panel.
    * Test default credentials
    * Test brute force password, with the default username

## WordPress

[![webenumerationv2](../../../_badges/thmp/webenumerationv2.svg)](https://tryhackme.com/room/webenumerationv2)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There are two **paid** solutions: [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/) and [WPScan](https://wpscan.com/). WPScan is providing a CLI tool for free and for non-commercial use available [here](https://wpscan.com/wordpress-security-scanner) (7.1k ‚≠ê).

```bash
# before every scan, update the local metadata database
$ wpscan --update
```

You can enumerate themes, plugins, and usernames.

```bash
# Look into the HTML, /wp-content/themes/... for themes
$ wpscan -url URL -e t
# Look into /wp-content/plugins/pluginname/... for plugins
# Use the README in each plugin to find the version
$ wpscan -url URL -e p
# Find users (look for ID in posts...)
$ wpscan -url URL -e u
```

You can use WPScan/hydra to bruteforce the login form.

```bash
$ wpscan -url URL -p wordlist -u username
$ hydra -l username -P wordlist URL http-form-post '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In&testcookie=1:S=Location' -V
```
</div><div>

You can select a mode between aggressive/passive when scanning. Some results might not be visible according to the mode selected, so you should try both if you can.

```bash
$ wpscan -url URL -e t --plugins-detection aggressive
$ wpscan -url URL -e t --plugins-detection passive
```

The CLI can be unleashed with WPScan API that will retrieve vulnerabilities  when scanning. The limit is 25 requests per day. See [Optional: WordPress Vulnerability Database API](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/wiki/WPScan-User-Documentation#optional-wordpress-vulnerability-database-api). You can also browse vulnerabilities manually: [WordPress](https://wpscan.com/wordpresses), [Plugins](https://wpscan.com/plugins), and [Themes](https://wpscan.com/themes).

```bash
# To list vulnerabilities, add a "v" before the enumerated type
# ex: vulnerable plugins
$ wpscan -url URL -e vp
```
