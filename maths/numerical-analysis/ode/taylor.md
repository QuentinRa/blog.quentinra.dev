# Taylor: the origin

[Go back](../index.md#euler)

It is based on the [Taylor's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem):

<div>
	\[ y(x_0 + h) \approx y(x_0) + h\times y\prime (x_0) \]
</div>

That we could rewrite
<div>
	\[ y(x_0) \approx y(x_0) + (x - x_0) \times y\prime (x_0) \]
</div>

with $h = x_0  - a$.

The approximation is pretty good when $h$ is really small ( $|h| << 1$ ).

For example, $\sqrt{1,44} = \sqrt{1 + 0,44} \approx \sqrt 1 + \frac{1}{2\sqrt 1} \times 0,44 \approx 1,22$ which is an approximation of $\sqrt{1,44} = 1,2$ .
