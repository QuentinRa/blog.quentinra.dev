# GDP

[Go back](..)

The GDP (`PIB` in French, variable is **Yt**) is an indicator of the economic
activity of a country. It's calculated by
evaluating either the

* production (sum of the final value of product/services)
* or the incomes (`revenus`)
* or the expenditures (sum of value added meaning the revenues
  minus the intermediate consumption)

We will differentiate two GDP

* Real GDP (`PIB réel/à prix constant`): price
  of a current year (fixed for all)
  multiplied by the quantity of the year
* Nominal GDP (`PIB nominal/à prix courant`): price
  of the current year multiplied by the quantity
