# Introduction

A Macroeconomic is a person observing the decision-making
of big actors like a country. As a macroeconomic,
you will observe these economics aggregates

* the PIB
* investments
* spending/purchases (`consommation` in French)
* growth
* prices

We will be observing 4 rational agents meaning that
they are spending everything in order to be happy/satisfied.

* household (`m√©ngages` in French)
* companies
* state (France for us)
* the rest of the World

**This course is quite theoretical**, even if you will have
some exercises, so feel free to improve (adding notes, 
advices ...) to help others go through this course and
get over with it...
