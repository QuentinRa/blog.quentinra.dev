# Introduction

A [macroeconomist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics)
is a person observing the decision-making
of big actors like a country. As a macroeconomist,
you will observe these economics aggregates

* the PIB
* investments
* spending/purchases (`consommation` in French)
* growth
* prices

We will be observing 4 
[rational agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent) 
meaning that they are spending everything in order to 
be happy/satisfied.

* household (`méngages` in French)
* companies
* state (France for us)
* the rest of the World (not considered in this course)

**This course is quite theoretical**, even if you will have
some exercises...Feel free to improve (adding notes, 
advices ...) to help others go through this course and
get over with it... Thanks!

## The goals

The economic policy is one of the 4 fundaments of the
macroeconomics. It's the means used to correct the
economic imbalance (``déséquilibre``) between
the supply (``offre``) and demand.

It's like in a marketplace, if no one is buying something
then the price would go down (since there is more
supply than demand) but if a lot of persons are buying
something then the price will skyrocket.

An agent will take decisions on

* the currency: increase/decrease interest rates
* his budget: change public spending / taxes rates
* the supply: change regulations, productivity, research, ...
