# Introduction

A [macroeconomist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics)
is a person observing the decision-making
of big actors like a country. As a macroeconomist,
you will observe these economics aggregates
(PIB, investments, growth, prices, ...)
for 4 
[rational agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent) 
(meaning that they are spending everything in order to 
be happy/satisfied).

* households (`ménages` in French)
* companies
* state (France for us)
* the rest of the World (not considered in this course)

**This course is quite theoretical**, even if you will have
some exercises...Feel free to improve (adding notes, 
advices ...) to help others go through this course and
get over with it... Thanks!

## The goals

The economic policy is one of the 4 fundaments of the
macroeconomics. It's the means used to correct the
economic imbalance (``déséquilibre``) between
the supply (``offre``) and demand.

It's like in a marketplace, if no one is buying something
then the price would go down (since there is more
supply than demand) but if a lot of persons are buying
something then the price will skyrocket unless the supply
increase.

An agent will take decisions on

* the currency: increase/decrease interest rates
* his budget: change public spending / taxes rates
* the supply: change regulations, productivity, research, ...

## How we will work

We will introduce some **variables** in order to easily
represent the economy. Most of the variables values will
be given in the exercise data. We have

* **exogenous** variables: usually given, calculated with external data
* **endogenous** variables: calculated using exogenous variables
  
In French, we say `` exogènes`` and `endogènes`.

We call **model** the representation of a economy
using variables. The inconvenient of a model is that
we won't take into account psychological problems,
history, ...

* **short term**: prices are not changing, we don't see
  the impact of changing a variable value
* **long term**: you need to evaluate adjustments to
    correct the consequences of a new policy

## GDP, unemployment, inflation

The GDP, the unemployment and the inflation are three
core concepts of the macroeconomic.

* [GDP](theory/gdp.md) (``PIB`` in French, variable `Yt`)
* [Unemployment](theory/unemployment.md) (``Chômage`` in French, `u = U/L` / `L = U + N`)
* [Inflation](theory/inflation.md) (price increase / decrease)
