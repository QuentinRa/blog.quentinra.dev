# Graph theory

A graph $G$ is a set of vertices <small>(or nodes)</small> $V$ connected by edges <small>(or links)</small> $E$. The notation is typically represented as $G(V, E)$. Edges can have a direction or not. A simple directed graph:

Graphs can be simple/complex and directed/undirected.

* **simple graph** 😎: up to one edge <small>(two in a directed graph)</small> between two vertices and no self-edges <small>(or loop, a node to itself)</small>. 
* **complex graphs** 🕸️: all graphs that are not simple graphs.
* **undirected graph** 🗺️: edges do not have a direction. The usual notation is: `(a,b)` for an edge between `a` and `b`. 
* **directed graph** 🛣️: edges are called arcs. They have a direction. The usual notation is: `[a,b]` for an edge from `a` to `b`.
