A graph $G$ is a set of vertices <small>(or nodes)</small> $V$ connected by edges <small>(or links)</small> $E$. The notation is typically represented as $G(V, E)$. Edges can have a direction or not. A simple directed graph:

Graphs can be simple/complex and directed/undirected.

* **simple graph** üòé: up to one edge <small>(two in a directed graph)</small> between two vertices and no self-edges <small>(or loop, a node to itself)</small>. 
* **complex graphs** üï∏Ô∏è: all graphs that are not simple graphs.
* **undirected graph** üó∫Ô∏è: edges do not have a direction. The usual notation is: `(a,b)` for an edge between `a` and `b`. 
* **directed graph** üõ£Ô∏è: edges are called arcs. They have a direction. The usual notation is: `[a,b]` for an edge from `a` to `b`.

#### Floyd‚ÄìWarshall Algorithm

This algorithm works with positive and negative weights. It has a complexity of $O(m^2)$. It gives the shortest path starting from any vertex to any vertex. First, create the incidence matrix:

* put the weight if you have one
* if vertex = self, then set $0$
* otherwise set $+\infty$

Then, $\forall{k, i, j}$ to $n$, apply this instruction: if the distance i,j $d(i,j)$ is greater than $z = d(i,k) + d(k,j)$, then $d(i,j) = z$.

#### Johnson's Algorithm

Johnson algorithm makes use of both Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's Algorithms. The shortest distance from $q$ to $X$ will be in $h[X]$.

* we are adding a vertex $q$ to our graph
* we are connecting this vertex to all vertices <small>(weight=0)</small>
* we are evaluating Bellman-Ford <small>(starting from $q$)</small>
* we got $n$ distances, stored in an array $h$

We then revaluate each weight: $w(X,Y) = w(X,Y) + h[X] - h[Y]$. Once the new graph is complete, we use Dijkstra's algorithm on it.
