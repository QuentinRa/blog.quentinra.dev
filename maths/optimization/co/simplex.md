# Simplex

[Go back](..)

This method is quite well-known so you may look
for some videos on the net since that might help
you understand.

## Standard form

You need to rewrite your constraints, you can only
have equations (no inequalities).
If you don't have an equation, you will have to introduce
what we call **slack variables** 
(`variables artificielles/d'Ã©cart/de bruit`
in French)

* ``>`` (or equals): `-` slack variables
* ``<`` (or equals): `+` slack variables

<div class="mb-3">
For instance <span class="mathjax_process">\(x < 5\)</span>
becomes 
<span class="mathjax_process">\(x + S_1 = 5\)</span> with
<span class="mathjax_process">\(S_1\)</span> a 
slack variable.
</div>

**Note**: if you added a negative slack variable,
because of ``>``, then you must use the `2-phases`
algorithm.

## Preparing your table

Create a matrix ``Ax = b``, with b the results of 
your equations and A the coefficients before
your variables in each equation.

<table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>base</th>
            <th>X</th>
            <th>Y</th>
            <th class="mathjax_process">\(...\)</th>
            <th class="mathjax_process">\(S_1\)</th>
            <th class="mathjax_process">\(...\)</th>
            <th class="mathjax_process">\(S_n\)</th>
            <th>b</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(S_1\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(a_{11}\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(a_{12}\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(...\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(1\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(0\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(0\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(b_1\)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>...</td>
            <td>...</td>
            <td>...</td>
            <td>...</td>
            <td>...</td>
            <td>...</td>
            <td>...</td>
            <td>...</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(S_n\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(a_{n1}\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(a_{n2}\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(...\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(0\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(0\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(1\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(b_n\)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="mathjax_process"></td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(c_{1}\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(c_{2}\)</td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(...\)</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td class="mathjax_process">\(R=0\)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The last line is the coefficient of each variable
in the function **f**. And 0 is the result of the
optimization since we haven't started yet.

## Minimization

If you are asked to minimize then

<ul>
<li> take the column with the smallest <code>c</code></li>
<li> if this column only have negatives values
    then ``end``</li>
<li class="mathjax_process"> we want the row having the lowest ratio
    \(S_i = b_i / a_{ij}\) so evaluate all the ratios
    for your column
    and find the row.</li>
</ul>

Now that you got your column and row, you will have to
put ``1`` inside and 0 in all the others values of the
diagonal. Since that's a matrix, simply use GAUSS.

<div> Once you did, if set a <code>1</code> in
<span class="mathjax_process">\(a_{11}\)</span>
then replace
<span class="mathjax_process">\(S_{1}\)</span>
(i=1)
in the <code>base</code> column
by the variable in the first (j=1) column so X.
</div>

**Stop**? When all the values in the last
line (reduced costs) are **positives**. The result
is ``-R``.

## Maximization

Same a minimization but take the
take the column with the biggest ``c``.

**Stop**? When all the values in the last
line (reduced costs) are **negatives**. The result
is ``-R``.
