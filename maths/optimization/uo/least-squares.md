# Least-squares

[Go back](..)

**I dunno what's this method. And why are you here in the first
place? Go away, we still haven't used it anyways!**

I won't go deep into what's this method because I don't know
but let's says that you have a plot of your function.

The goal is to create a line. This line should be the best
one, meaning the distance with the point of your function
and this line is the fewer possible.

That's quite used in linear regression in statistics, basically
you will minimize the sum of the squares of the vertical distance
between your points and the line.
