# Minimum (local)

[Go back](..)

If we are taking an interval [x,y], then the minimum
on this interval is called `Minimum (local)`
(or local optimum).

The minimum is strict if we only got one if the interval
<span class="tms">
(for instance we can have two points having 0,0 the minimum
for our function xxx, this minimum isn't strict)
</span>.

<div>
Not tired of formulas ?
<span>\(x^*\)</span>
is a 
minimum local 
if we have a 
<span>\(\epsilon > 0\)</span>
giving us
<span>\(x \in X \cap B(x*,\epsilon) f(x*) \geq f(x)\)</span>.
</div>
