# Critical point

[Go back](..)

A critical point means that 

<p>
\[
\nabla f(x*) = 0
\]
</p>

Nabla is a symbol that we will see a bit later with gradients
and hessians.

**Please, take note of these**

<ul>
    <li>If <span>
  \( 
    x^* \)</span> is a critical point and the hessian
is definite positive, then <span>
  \( 
    x^* \)</span> is a minimum local strict</li>
    <li>If <span>
  \( 
    x^* \)</span> is a critical point and the hessian
is semi-definite positive for each z in X, then <span>
  \( 
    x^* \)</span> is a minimum global</li>
</ul>
