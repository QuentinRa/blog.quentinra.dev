# Optimization

The main idea is that we know
in a graph (for instance like a graph a all cities) how
to find the shortest path. Now we are not using
graph and nodes but a **function** (ex: a pricing function)
and we want to know the highest (**maximum**)
or the lowest (**minimum**) value that this function would take.

So here you will have

* optimization without constraints
* optimization under constraints
* optimization in R
