# Almost sure convergence

[Go back](..#convergence)

In French, it's `Convergence presque s√ªre`.
The sequence $X_n$ converges almost surely if

@
\mathbb{P}(\lim_{n \to+ \infty} X_n = x) = 1
@

It's that's the case then $x$ is a constant $c$
and the notation is

@
X_n \xrightarrow{a.s.} c
@

This means that when $n\to+ \infty$ 
then almost surely $X_n \to c$.
