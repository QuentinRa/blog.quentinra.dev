# Convergence in (quadratic/square) mean

[Go back](..#convergence)

In French, it's `Convergence en moyenne quadratique`.
The sequence $X_n$ converges in mean=
quadratic mean=square mean if

@
\mathbb{E}(\lim_{n \to+ \infty} |X_n-x|^2) \lt \gamma \hspace{0.5cm}and\hspace{0.5cm} \forall{\gamma},\ \gamma \gt 0

It's that's the case then $x$ is a constant $c$
and the notation is

@
X_n \xrightarrow{m.s.} c
