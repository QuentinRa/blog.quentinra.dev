# Convergence in (quadratic/square) mean

[Go back](..#convergence)

In French, it's `Convergence en moyenne quadratique`. The sequence $X_n$ converges in mean=quadratic mean=square mean if

@
\lim_{n \to+ \infty} \mathbb{E}((X_n-x)^2) = 0
@

It's that's the case then $x$ is a constant $c$ and the notation is

@
X_n \xrightarrow{m.s.} c
