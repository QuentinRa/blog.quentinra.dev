# Probabilities

<div class="row row-cols-lg-2"><div>

A probability is a value between zero and one characterizing how likely an event may occur.

* 🛣️ $\omega$ (small-omega) is an outcome possible
* 🗺️ $\Omega$ (big-omega) is a set of all possible outcomes, also called sample/probability space
* 📌 $A$ is an event included in <span>$\Omega$. It's often  defined by a sentence.
* 🌍 $\overline{A}$ or $A^c$ is opposite/complementary event of A <small>(read as "not A")</small>.
* ⛔ $\emptyset$ (empty set) means an impossible event.

👉 An event that has one outcome in called elementary event.

👉 Events "incompatible/disjoints/mutually exclusive events" are events that can't happen simultaneously.

For instance, we are rolling a die 3 times in a row 🎲.

* An outcome is 🛣️: $(6, 1, 2)$
* The probability space 🗺️: $\lbrace\ (x, y, z) \mid x y z \in [1,6]\ \rbrace$
* An event $A$ 📌: having 3 times 6, e.g., $(6, 6, 6)$
* Complementary event $\overline{A}$ 🌍: not having 3 times 6
* An impossible event ⛔: none

👉 The cardinal of a set $E$, $card(E) \Leftrightarrow |E| \Leftrightarrow \\#E$, means the number of elements in $E$.
