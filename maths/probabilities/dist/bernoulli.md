# Bernoulli distribution

[Go back](..)

Bernoulli is used when a random variable is either 0 or 1
(like flipping a coin).

This distribution $Ber(n,p)$ represents the probability
of success on $n$ trials with a probability of $p$.

* The distribution function is $\mathbb{P}(X=k) = p^k * (1-p)^{n-k}$
* $\mathbb{E}(X) = \ p$
* $\mathbb{V}(X) = \ p * (1-p)$

A binomial distribution is a repetition of Bernoulli
distributions so you should check binomial distribution
to understand Bernoulli better.
