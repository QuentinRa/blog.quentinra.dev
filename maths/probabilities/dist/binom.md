# Binomial distribution

[Go back](..)

The binomial distribution $B(n,p)$ represents the probability
of success on $n$ trials with a probability of $p$.

* The mass function is

<div>
\[
\begin{split}\begin{cases}
\mathbb{P}(X=k) = 0 & if & k > n  \\
\mathbb{P}(X=k) =  C_n^k * p^k * (1-p)^{n-k}  & else  \\
\end{cases}\end{split}
\]
</div>

* $\mathbb{E}(X) = \ n * p$
* $\mathbb{V}(X) = \ n * p * (1-p)$
