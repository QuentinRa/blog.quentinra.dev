# Normal distribution

[Go back](..#distributions)

The distribution is the most important one, also called

* Normal distribution/``Loi normale``
* Gaussian distribution/``Loi gaussienne``
* Laplace–Gauss distribution/``Loi de Laplace-Gauss``

And the short name is $N(\mu, \sigma)$ or
$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$.

* $\mu$ (mu) is the mean ($\mathbb{E}(X)$)
* $\sigma$ (sigma) is the deviation around the mean,
  known as Standard deviation/`écart-type`.
* $\sigma^2$ (sigma-square) is the variance ($\mathbb{V}(X)$)

So we have

* The density function is $f_X(x) = {\frac {1}{\sigma {\sqrt {2\pi }}}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)^{2}}$
* $\mathbb{E}(X) = \ \mu$
* $\mathbb{V}(X) = \ \sigma^2$
