# Exponential distribution

[Go back](..)

The exponential distribution is $E(\lambda)$. You should look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) if you want to know why it's used.

* The density function is $f_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda{x}}$
* $\mathbb{E}(X) = \ \frac{1}{\lambda}$
* $\mathbb{V}(X) = \ \frac{1}{\lambda^2}$
