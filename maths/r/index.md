# Introduction

File extension is ``.R`` but we also write
``.Rmd`` files that are file with documentation
and runnable R code. You may also directly run some
code in the console.

Most people code in R using [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
but I will use [R plugin for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6632-r-language-for-intellij)
that is exactly the same as R Studio but in IntelliJ.

You may have to install package or libraries in the future,
simply do

* install a library : ``install.packages("name")``
* **load a library** (runtime) : ``library("nom");``
