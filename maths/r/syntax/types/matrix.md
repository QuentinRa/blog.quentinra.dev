# Matrix

[Go back](../../index.md)

This is the same as a matrix in Maths. This is a
vector of vectors. The function is ``matrix(data, nrow, ncol)``.

```r
matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
#       [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]    1    3    5
# [2,]    2    4    6

matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = T)
#       [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]    1    2    3
# [2,]    4    5    6
```

## Indexes

This is the same as for vectors, but you got
two indexes separated by a comma ``,``. The format
is ``[line, column]``. If you omit one, then the whole
line/column will be returned (or the whole matrix if both
are omitted).

```r
m[,] # whole matrix
m[1,] # first line
m[,1] # first column
m[1,1] # value at 1,1 (first line, first column)
```

Sometimes, you will have to use ``m[i,j,drop=FALSE]`` because
R is dereferencing your matrix to a vector.

## Functions

* ``t(m)``: transpose
* ``solve(m)``: inverse a matrix
* ``solve(A,b)``: solve $Ax=b$
* ``diag(...)``: create a diagonal matrix
* ``m1 %*% m2``: scalar product
* ``eigen(m)``: eigen values

## Utilities

* ``dim(m)``: dimension
* ``ncol(m)``: number of columns
* ``nrow(m)``: number of rows
* ``cbind(vector1, matrix1, matrix2, vector2, ...)``: merge into one matrix (left to right)
* ``rbind(matrix1, matrix2, vector1, vector2, ...)``: merge into one matrix (top to bottom)
* ``dimnames(m)``: column/rows names
* ``colnames(m)``: column names
* ``rownames(m)``: rows names

As you should remember, you can override the values
by placing them at the left-side of the operator `<-`.

```r
y <- 1:9
dim(y) <- c(3,3)
# a vector with a dimension is a matrix
y
#     [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]  1    4    7
# [2,]  2    5    8
# [3,]  3    6    9
```
