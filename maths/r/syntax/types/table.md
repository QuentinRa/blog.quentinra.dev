# Contingency tables

[Go back](../../index.md)

A contingency table (`tableau de contingenc/à double entrées`)
is a table of

* the uniques values of a vector
* by the number of times this values is present

```r
# picking 50 values within [0,10]
vect <- sample(0:10, 50, replace = TRUE)
table(vect)
# 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
# 4  6  4  6  5  5  5  6  6  1  2
```

You can read the each of your eleven values were
at least picked once. For instance, we picked $10$ twice.

## Frequencies table

You can use ``prop.table`` to get the frequency
of each value instead of the number of occurrences.

* `prop.table(table(v), 1)` (line only)
* `prop.table(table(v), 2)` (column only)

## More complex tables

If you are calling table like this, while providing
a qualitative variable (the unique values) and
a quantitative variable (the values)

```r
table(ech$qual, ech$quant)
```

Then you may try to use

```r
xtabs(~ qual + quant, ech)
```

The main difference is that ``xtabs`` is using
formulas so when you learned them, you will be able
to do quite the great contingency tables.
