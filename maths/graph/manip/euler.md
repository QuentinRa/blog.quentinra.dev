# Eulerian graph

[Go back](..)

An eulerian graph is

* a connected graph
* having all degrees even (two odd allowed, see semi)
* that have a least one eulerian graph/path

We are calling eulerian,
a cycle/circuit/chain/path traversing **each edge once**.

We are adding "semi-" before eulerian
is the graph have exactly 2 odd degrees, because
adding one edge will make the graph eulerian.
