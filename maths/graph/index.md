# Introduction

A graph $G$, is a set of **vertices** (=nodes=`sommets/nœuds`) $V$
linked by **edges** (=links=`arrêtes`) $E$ giving us the notation
$G(V, E)$. Vertices can have a direction or not.

You will use graphs in databases in GraphDatabase,
check the NoSQL course if that was what you are looking
for.

## Vocabulary

A graph can be simple/multiple and directed or not.

* **simple graph** (``graphe simple``): up to one edge between
  two vertices (2 if directed graph) and no loop/self-edges.
* **multiple edges graph** (`graphe complexes`): graphs that are not simple graphs
* **undirected graph** (`Graphe non orientés (GNO)`): edges have a direction,
  they are written $[a,b]$
* **directed graph** (`Graphe orientés (GO)`): edges do not have a direction,
  they are written $(a,b)$

Then here is the vocabulary

* **?** (`?`): ?
