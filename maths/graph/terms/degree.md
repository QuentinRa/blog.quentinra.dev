# Degree matrix

[Go back](..#advanced-terminology)

The degree matrix or ``matrice des degr√©s``
is a diagonal matrix of the degree of each vertex.
For instance if $d(A)=4$ then $a_{A,A} = 1$.

It used, according to wikipedia, with the adjacency matrix
to make the Laplacian matrix (`matrice de Laplace`). It looks interesting
since that's looks like the optimization course but I have
yet to learn more about it.
