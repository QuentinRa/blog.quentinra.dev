# Planar graph

[Go back](..#advanced-terminology)

A planar graph (`Graphe planaire`), is a graph
that could be drawn without having two edges crossing
each other.
In French, we are calling ``Graphe planaire topologique``,
the planar representation of a planar graph.

When we are drawing a planar graph, we will have

* **face** (`Face`)

This is a part of the graph delimited by edges. You know
the bucket tool in image editor software? A face is something
colored by the bucked tool in one go. You got at least one
unbounded face, which is the one not colored after
coloring all of your faces.

* bounded face/`face finie`
* external or unbounded face/`face infine`

* **???** (`Fronti√®re/contour`)

This is the edges used by a face, the vertex must not be
used twice in the same face. in a ``Graphe planaire topologique``,
the ??? are forming a cycle basis.
