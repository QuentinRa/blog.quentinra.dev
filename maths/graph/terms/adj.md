# Adjacency matrix

[Go back](..#advanced-terminology)

This may also be called the boolean matrix (rarely) or ``Matrice d’adjacence/Matrice booléenne``. This is a matrix vertex by vertex, and the value are 0 or 1. If we are at row=A, col=B 

* **1**: $A \to B$ exists 
* **0**: $A \to B$ do not exist 

Notes

* in a undirected graph, the matrix is symmetric.
* if the vertex is looping, we are adding a 2 on the
diagonal (and that's can't be called boolean matrix anymore)

This matrix is quite convenient because if $A$ is the adjacency matrix, then $A^p$ is
the adjacent matrix after $p$ transition. You can use that to know after $p$ steps, where you can go.

## Example 1

The adjacency matrix for

is

<div>
\[
\displaylines{
\hspace{0.7cm}\begin{array}{} a&b&c&d&h&i \end{array} \ \ \
\\
\begin{array}{} a\\b\\c\\d\\h\\i \end{array}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0  \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
\end{pmatrix}
}
\]
</div>

## Example 2

The adjacency matrix for

![](images/adj2.svg)

is

<div>
\[
\displaylines{
\hspace{0.7cm}\begin{array}{} a&b&c&d&h&i \end{array} \ \ \
\\
\begin{array}{} a\\b\\c\\d\\h\\i \end{array}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0  \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0  \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1  \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1  \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\
\end{pmatrix}
}
\]
</div>

You may have noticed but if we add the edge (d,i),
we got a Wheel ($W_{6}$).
