# Dijkstra's algorithm

[Go back](..)

If $G$ is a weighted graph with **only positives weights** then you can use dijkstra's algorithm (complexity $O(n^2)$).

Dijkstra will give you the shortest path starting from a vertex (`A` for instance) to any other vertices (B, ...).

The easiest way to modelize the dijkstra's algorithm is a table of the steps (i=0 to n) by the vertices (A, B, ...). A case like (0,A) is representing the shortest path value after 0 iterations.

At $i=0$, the shortest path value is $0$ for your starting vertex and $+\infty$ for all other vertex. You will also consider your selected vertex done, meaning that the value as the shortest path value is the final result.

At $i+1$, (**it's a bit hard to explain, learn with the example**)

* if there is an edge between the last done vertex and another one having the weight $w$
* if the other one is not "done"
* and the other one weight is greater $w+\text{last done value}$
* then we replace the shortest path value by $w+\text{last done value}$

Then, once you did all that, you will set as done the vertex having the least weight until all of them are done.

## Example

![](images/dijkstra.svg)

| Step |   A  |   B  |   C  |   D  |   E  | Done |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| $0$  | $0$  | $+\infty$ | $+\infty$ | $+\infty$ | $+\infty$ | $A$ |

$A$ is linked to $B$ by 10 and to $E$ by 5. We are replacing both $+\infty$ since the new weights are smaller ($0+10$ and $0+5$). We are writing $A(10)$ to remember what value was used for B sum ($0+10$, the $0$ is A value).

| Step |   A  |   B  |   C  |   D  |   E  | Done |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| $0$  | $0$  | $+\infty$ | $+\infty$ | $+\infty$ | $+\infty$ | $A$ |
| $1$  | $0$  |$A(10)$|$+\infty$|$+\infty$|$A(5)$|$E$|

For the third line, $E(8)$ in $B$ column means that we added the value of $E=5$ plus the weight for $weight(E \to B)=3$. The idea is the same so we are filling our table.

| Step |   A  |   B  |   C  |   D  |   E  | Done |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| $0$  | $0$  | $+\infty$ | $+\infty$ | $+\infty$ | $+\infty$ | $A$ |
| $1$  |      |$A(10)$|$+\infty$|$+\infty$|$A(5)$|$E$|
| $2$  |      |$E(8)$|$E(14)$|$E(7)$|     |  $D$ |
| $3$  |      |$E(8)$|$D(13)$|      |     |  $B$ |
| $4$  |      |      |$B(9)$|      |      |  $C$ |

For the interpretation, the shortest path from A to ... is ...

* A to B is $[A-E-B]$ (weight=8)
* A to C is $[A-E-B-C]$ (weight=9)
* A to D is $[A-E-D]$ (weight=7)
* A to D is $[A-E]$ (weight=5)

If you are wondering how I got these results, for $A to B$, the weight is the value in the column: $8$ and for the path

* B
* go back to E (since $E(8)$)
* go back to A (since $A(5)$)
* giving us $[A-E-B]$
