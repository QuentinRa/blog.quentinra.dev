# Spanning tree

[Go back](..)

A spanning tree $T$ of a Graph $G$ is a partial graph of
$G$ that is a tree, meaning we are removing edges until
we have a tree.

* do not exists if $G$ is disconnected
* T is a partial connected and acyclic graph of G
* the edges removed are making a cycle basis (`base de cycles`)
