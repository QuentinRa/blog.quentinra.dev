# Model

[Go back](..)

A model is mainly made of **a distribution function**, and its **parameters**.

Usually, you need to estimate the parameters (see likelihood, estimators, ... a bit further), but sometimes (a maybe most of the time) you can't find the exact value. What we usually do when giving the parameters is also giving a **confidence interval**! So that every person reading our model knows the range of each parameter.`
