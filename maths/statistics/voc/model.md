# Model

[Go back](..)

Usually it's

* a distribution function
* the distribution parameters

Usually you need to estimate the parameters (see
likehood, estimators, ... a bit further) but sometimes
(a maybe most of the time) you can't find the exact value.
What we usually do when giving the parameters is
also giving a **confidence interval**! So that every person
reading our model know how the parameters are "distributed".
