# Empiric

[Go back](../index.md#maths-recap)

Let's say you got an sample. If you are calculating the
mean of the sample, we are saying that you calculated
the empirical mean (`moyenne empirique`). This is because,
you used the values instead of the theory.

You got

* empirical moments (mean, ...)
* empirical quantiles
* order statistic (`statistiques de rang/d'ordre`)
* ...

The main idea is that you got a vector of size $n$
like $n$ observations and after the empiric estimation,
you got a vector of size $1$. You may ask yourself, how
much information did you lost? Because sometimes, you really
lost a lot of information.
