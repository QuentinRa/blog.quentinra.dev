# Paired data

[Go back](..)

What we call **paired**-data (Données appariés in French)
is when you have two sample
about the same individuals but like one in winter and another
one in summer, ... So at 2 different times.

That's something important to notice since the property
of **independence** is not valid here so most of our usual tests
won't work on this dataset.
