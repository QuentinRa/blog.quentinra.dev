# Method of moments

[Go back](../index.md#estimators-and-likehood)

We are evaluating empirically the moments
and comparing them with those of our theoretical
distribution.

1. find the moment's formulas
2. calculate the empirical moments
3. find the vector $\hat\theta$ so that the moments
   of the $theta$ distribution are the closest
   of our theoretical distribution's moments
