# Method of moments

[Go back](../index.md#estimators-and-likelihood)

We are evaluating empirically the moments, and comparing them with those of our theoretical distribution.

1. find the moment's formulas
2. calculate the empirical moments
3. find the vector $\hat\theta$, so that the moments of the $theta$ distribution are the closest of those of our theoretical distribution
