# Statistical inference

[Go back](..)

You need to verify that
the model hypothesis seems to be true.
That's the hardest part, you will deal with
estimators, likehood, tests, ...

## Normal distribution

According to the Central limit theorem
(`Théorème de la limite centrale`)

<div>
\[
X ~ \lim_{n \to +\infty} N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{n})
\]
</div>

You will use this a lot, because some tests have the
normal distribution requirement so testing that your
distribution follow a normal distribution may be
required.
