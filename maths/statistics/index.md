## Introduction

The main idea is that you got some **data** and you need to
find how this data got generated (what distribution function?
what were the parameters?...). Once we have our **model**,
then we can do thing like trying to guess the future.

* [Population](voc/population.md) : data we are observing, a matrix
* [Variables](voc/variables.md) : the columns of our matrix, can be quantitative or qualitative
* [Individuals](voc/individuals.md) : the rows of our matrix
* [Sample](voc/sample.md), Ã©chantillon : a part of our population
* [Model](voc/model.md) : characterization of the dataset

And some more if you want

* [Population (paired)](voc/paired.md) : you took two times the data from the same indivuals
