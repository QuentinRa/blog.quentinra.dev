# Covariance

[Go back](..)

The covariance is a value in [0,1]. If two
variable are independents then ``cov=0`` but `cov=0`
do not imply that two variable are independents.

* if cov is around 0 then the dependency if weak
* if cov is around -1 then the dependency if negatively strong
* if cov is around 1 then the dependency if positively strong

otherwise we can't really say something.
