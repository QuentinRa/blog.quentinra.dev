# Quantiles

[Go back](../index.md#maths-recap)

Quantiles are values that are splitting the distribution in X part (4 = quartile, 10 = decile, 100 = centile). When dealing with **quartiles**, the values that the distribution will take will most likely be within those two bounds.

* $Q_1 - 1.5 * (Q_3-Q_1)$
* $Q_1 + 1.5 * (Q_3-Q_1)$
