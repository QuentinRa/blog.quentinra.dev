# Covariance

[Go back](../index.md#maths-recap)

The covariance is a value in [0,1]. If two variables are independents, then ``cov=0`` but `cov=0` does not imply that the two variables are independent.

* if cov is around 0 then the dependency is weak
* if cov is around -1 then the dependency is negatively strong
* if cov is around 1 then the dependency is positively strong

Otherwise, we can't really say something.
