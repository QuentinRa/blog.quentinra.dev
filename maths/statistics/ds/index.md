# Descriptive statistics

[Go back](..)

You need to come up with
a model for your distribution. Use plots, functions etc.
and try to find as much properties as you can.
This is the easiest part of the statistics (at least
for non-mathematicians).

You will use normal plots, histograms and box plots a lot.
The first thing to do when having data in your hand would
be to check the variables you are interested in with
an histogram or a box plot. In you notice outliers with
the boxplot (see next part), deal with it. You may notice
something and checking other diagram, you may come up with
ideas.

* look at the moments of your distribution
* check if your distribution is following a normal
  distribution (useful in tests)
* try to generate another distribution and compare
  it with your sample
* check if your variables are independent/dependant
* ...

## Outliers

An outlier (`valeurs anormales/aberrantes/extrÃªmes`)
are values that looks out of place when observing your
distribution. They are impacting your work a lot, because
they are impacting the mean.

Let's say you got some grades like ``10,10,12`` and
your teacher made a mistake and submitted ``10,10,120``.

* ``mean(c(10,10,120)) = 46.66/20``
* ``median(c(10,10,120)) = 10/20``

You can notice outliers easily with a boxplot, and you
should remove/ignore/fix them. The median is not affected
by outliers so it's more robust.

## QQ-plot

The Quantile-Quantile plot (QQ plot) is a plot in which
we are comparing the quantiles of a distribution with
the quantile of another one. It used to check if it's
likely that our data is following a distribution.

```r
qqnorm(ech$var)
# qqnorm(ech$var, datax = TRUE)

# test with poisson distribution
qqline(rpois(100, mean(ech$var)))
```

We can see on this graph that is does not seems that
our sample is following a poisson distribution.

## Side note

This is a hint,
try to remember distribution properties
because that might help.

* we know that for a poisson distribution, mean=variance=parameter
* if we are observing a $mean=3$, $var \simeq 3$, then we could check a
  poisson distribution with $\lambda=3$
* this is not an accurate hint, just a hint as to how
  you could try to think (if you are lost, that is).
