# ILO

ILO "Introduction aux Langages orientés-Objets" is not an easy course. You will need strength and motivation to survive 👀. <small>Joke aside, it's not that hard to survive, but I mean "survive without cheating/submitting your friend work, while learning something", as a lot of persons are giving up</small>.

* [Figures TP](figures/index.md)
* [Lists TP](lists/index.md)
* [Tchat TP](tchat/index.md)
* [MCQ about TPs](mcq.md)

And that's all I can do. As a side note, we have a **Java** course with a section about **JavaFX** and **Tests** with JUnit. We also have a course about **Design patterns** and **C++**.
