# Folder

[Go back](../c.md)

You can use this trick to document a folder or a package. Create a file `package.dox`

```c
/** @dir headers

\authors ...
\date 2020-03-08

A description of this package/folder.
*/
```

When folders are documented, they appear in `m.css doxygen` files list (if you are using m.css renderer).
