# MCQ about Beginner part

[Go back](../index.md#beginner)

I do admit that some questions are too complex for a beginner, but they aren't that hard, and some of them are fun (are least to me), so I hope you will learn a lot ðŸ˜„.

<hr class="sl">

## Question 1

How many primitives types there are in Java?

<blockquote class="spoiler">
<b>8</b>! Don't you dare forget this :(
</blockquote>

<hr class="sr">

## Question 2

On how many bits the primitive type ``char`` is defined?

<blockquote class="spoiler">
It's <b>16</b> bits and not 8 like usual, because Java bet that we will use UTF-16 but, unfortunately for them, UTF-8 was the one that became the most used.
</blockquote>

<hr class="sl">

## Question 3

Could you guess what's this code doing?

```java
public class Math {
    private static final float value = 2.0;

    public static float increaseN(float n){ return n + value; }
}
```

<blockquote class="spoiler">
It's not working! <b>2.0</b> is a double not a float! But increase n is working properly and return n plus the value 2.
</blockquote>

<hr class="sr">

## Question 4

Which instruction are we using in Java to go to the next turn of a loop? (next, pass, continue, skip, do, goto)

<blockquote class="spoiler">
It's the keyword <b>continue</b>!
</blockquote>

<hr class="sl">

## Question 5

What's the difference between ``==`` and `equals`.

<blockquote class="spoiler">
None by default, they both check if two objects have the same address. But a class can override <b>equals</b> and check the value rather than the address. For primitives types, <b>==</b> is checking the value.
</blockquote>

<hr class="sr">

## Question 6

What's this code is doing ``object.equals(null)``?

<blockquote class="spoiler">
This code is returning false if object is not null, but if object is null, we have <b>null.method(...)</b> meaning that we will trigger a <b>NullPointerException</b>.
</blockquote>

<hr class="sl">

## Question 7

What are we doing in this statement: ``public interface Human implements Living {}`` with Living another interface?

<blockquote class="spoiler">
The keyword is <b>wrong</b>, we should use <b>extends</b>. If extends was used, then implementing Human would requires to also implements Living methods.
</blockquote>

<hr class="sr">

## Question 8

How many methods a ``FunctionalInterface`` can have?

<blockquote class="spoiler">
One abstract method, no other restrictions. 
</blockquote>

<hr class="sl">

## Question 9

With A a superclass, and B a subclass, using **Liskov substitution principle** (`polymorphisme d'hÃ©ritage`), what statement are valid?

- ``B v1 = new A()``
- ``A v2 = new B()``
- subclass instances can be considered as superclass instances
- superclass instances can be considered as subclass instances
- call a method on of `v2` only defined in class `B`
- call a method on of `v2` defined in class `A`

<blockquote class="spoiler">
Statements 2,3,6 are valid. In 5, v2 is of type A so you can't call B methods (even if the real instance is of type B). In statement 1, A doesn't have the new methods declared in B so that won't work. Same answer for statement 4.
</blockquote>

<hr class="sr">

## Question 10

In java >= 8, an interface can have

* constant class attributes ?
* non constant class attributes ?
* constant instance attributes ?
* non constant instance attributes ?
* concrete instance methods ?
* abstract instance methods ?
* class methods ?

<blockquote class="spoiler">
Concrete (since java>=8) or abstract methods. constant class attributes and class methods.
</blockquote>

<hr class="sl">

## Question 11

How do we call what we are doing when we are declaring a lot of methods with the same name in a class?

<blockquote class="spoiler">
It's called <b>Overloading</b> (=overload=surcharge in French) a method.
</blockquote>
