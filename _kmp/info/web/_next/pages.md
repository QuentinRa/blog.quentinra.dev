# GitHub pages

[Go back](../../../../_it/dev/git/index.md#advanced-concepts)

An organization or a user can make on GitHub a "GitHub page" project. To summarize, you can make a website from the code of a repository having the same name as your username/organization name. Then GitHub will host the website for you.

Check the [tutorial](https://pages.github.com/).

Your website URL will be like `https://username.github.io/`. You can change that with a custom name, that you brought beforehand for 10$ per year (for a domain.com
for example) by following the steps for [custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).

You can use [form spree](https://formspree.io/) to use forms without coding.
