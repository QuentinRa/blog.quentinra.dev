# Security

* [Captcha](captcha.md): if you want to make sure that your users are real humans (ReCaptcha/hCaptcha)
* [Front-End code exposed](code.md): your code is running in someone else browser, so they can do what they want with it
* [Subresource Integrity (SRI)](sri.md): it's good to use CDN, but did you know that there are risks?
* [Headers](headers.md): often overlooked, but the headers send with your page will increase the security, and prevent some well-known attacks
* [add rel attribute to external links](links.md): it seems unneeded as of 2021
* [forbidden usernames](usernames.md): do not let users take "root", "admin", ... as their username
* [FORM (GET, POST) and URLs](url.md): for beginners, some note about "/user/{id}"
