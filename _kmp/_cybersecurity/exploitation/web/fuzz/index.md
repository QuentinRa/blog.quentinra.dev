# Fuzzing

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Fuzzing, or most likely web-fuzzing is the art of injecting data, and finding something,usually a bug. Fuzzers are used for way too many things

* Brute force a form
* Subdomains exploration
* Forced browsing
* Find Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
* Try exploiting headers
* ...
</div><div>

**Two ingredients are required**. The first one is a **wordlist**, which is basically a list of values to test. [See Wordlists](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/general/index.md#-wordlists-).

The second is a **URL**. For instance, `example.com`. Fuzzers will allow you to set the location in the URL that you want to inject using FUZZ

* Guessing a subdomain? `FUZZ.example.com`
* Forced browsing? `example.com/FUZZ`
* Find Insecure Direct Object References? `example.com?id=FUZZ`
* ...

> FUZZ will be replaced with the values in the wordlist, one by one.
</div></div>

> Fun fact 🎉: you can also use [Gobuster](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/web/fuzz/forced_browsing.md#gobuster-go) for fuzzing with (`gobuster fuzz`).

## ffuf - fuzz faster u fool

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) (8.1k ⭐) is a modern version of wfuzz in Go. In theory, the repository [ffuf-scripts](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf-scripts) should have a list of scripts useful with ffuf.

Examples

```bash
$ ffuf -w wordlist -u URL/FUZZ
$ ffuf -w wordlist -u URL?FUZZ=value
$ ffuf -w wordlist -u URL?key=FUZZ
$ ffuf -w wordlist -u URL/FUZZ -H "Header: value"
$ ffuf -w wordlist -u URL -X POST -d "xxx=FUZZ"
```

* `-w wordlist`: FUZZ will be replaced with each entry in the wordlist
* `-u URL`: URL/endpoint where the request is made
* `-H header_value`: a header, or a list of headers comma separated
* `-X method`: the method used (GET/POST..;). Default: GET.
* `-d payload`: POST payload

You can use multiple wordlists, in such cases, you won't use FUZZ, but your own keyword, such as W1/W2.

```bash
$ ffuf -w wordlist1:W1,wordlist2:W2 -u URL?w1=W1&w2=W2 [...]
```
</div><div>

You will most likely want to only show some answers, or filter=hide some answers, based on a criterion. A filter switch is starting with `-f`, while a show switch is starting with `-m`.

* `c code`: show/hide response with this code
* `l n`: show/hide responses with this $n$ number of lines
* `w n`: show/hide responses with this $n$ number of words
* `s size`: show/hide responses with a size equal to $s$
* `r regex`: show/hide responses matching the regex

```bash
$ ffuf -fc 404,500 [...] # hides 404,500
$ ffuf -fc 400-404 [...] # hides 400 to 404
$ ffuf -mc 200 [...] # show only 200
$ ffuf -mc 200,301 [...] # show only 200,301
$ ffuf -fs 5230 [...] # hides responses with size=5230
```
</div></div>

## wfuzz - web (application) fuzzer

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz) (4.7k ⭐) is a web fuzzer in Python.

Example

```bash
$ wfuzz -w wordlist URL/account?id=FUZZ
```

You can add some verbose, if you want to.

```bash
$ wfuzz -w wordlist -u URL/FUZZ -v
```

</div><div>

You can filter responses by code. `-h` will hide a response based on a criterion... And, `-s`, which is working the same, will do the opposite, and only show a response matching a criterion.

* `c code`: show/hide responses with this return code
* `l n`: show/hide responses with this $n$ number of lines
* `w n`: show/hide responses with this $n$ number of words
* `c n`: show/hide responses with this $n$ number of characters
* `s regex`: show/hide responses containing the regex

```bash
# ignore 404,500
$ wfuzz -w wordlist --hc 404,500 xxx.tld/account?id=FUZZ
# show only 200
$ wfuzz -w wordlist --sc 200 xxx.tld/account?id=FUZZ
```
</div></div>
