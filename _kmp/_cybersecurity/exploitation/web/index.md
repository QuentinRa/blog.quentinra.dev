*According to TryHackMe, there are 4 categories of failures related to webservices.*

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

**Identification and Authentication Failure** üîë

* The website does not prevent brute force
* The website allows users to use weak passwords
* The website does not encrypt passwords
	
<br>

**Broken Access Control** üì≠ <small>(users can access files/URLs they shouldn't)</small>

* The principle of the least privilege is not applied correctly
* Someone can use someone else token/ID to do...
* A user can access "logged-only" pages without logging in
</div><div>

**Injections** ü™§

* There is insufficient or no validation at all
* There is insufficient or no sanitization at all

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Cryptographic Failures** üîì

* The server is using clear text
* The server allows/uses HTTP instead of HTTPS
* The server uses a weak cryptographic algorithm

## Terminology

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

A URL is a suite of: a scheme (http/https), a username, a password, `@`, a domain, `:`, a port, a route, a query (`?`), and a fragment (`#`). Most parameters are optional, the URLs you will use will mostly look like this

```
http://example.com
http://example.com:80
https://example.com
https://example.com:443
https://example.com/route/?query#fragment
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1:80
[...]
```

* Web Application Firewall (WAF): protect web apps against DDOS/..., and analyze/limit-rate traffic from bots.

* Content Delivery Networks (CDN): servers that are used to store static resources of a website. When a website needs a resource, the nearest CDN server is used, allowing a faster response.

* Load Balancers: interface between clients and server, distributing the load among the available servers using algorithms such as round-robin <small>(in turn)</small>, or weighted <small>(is server busy?)</small>. There are periodic checks to ensure that servers are still online, and if there is no response, a server is considered down until proven otherwise.

[OWASP](https://owasp.org/) (The Open Source Foundation for Application Security Project) is a foundation that is very well-known for its resources to improve website security. The release every year the [**Top 10 vulnerabilities**](https://owasp.org/Top10/).
