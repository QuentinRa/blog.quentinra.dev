# Forms

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

There is also a variable **\$\_REQUEST** which contains both values in \\$\_GET, and values in \\$\_POST. If a value is both in \\$\_POST, AND \\$\_GET, then **only the value in \\$\_POST will be kept**.

> **Note**: to be fair, `$_REQUEST` may also have the values inside `$_COOKIES`, values which are overriding values in `$_POST`. It's disabled by default, due to security concerns.

**Some logic flaws when using $\_REQUEST**

* a developer might use `$_REQUEST` for a GET form. Let's say that the developer sanitized/ensured that the value in `$_GET` is clean, then we can bypass the check by sending both data in `$_GET` and `$_POST`.

```bash
$ curl 'URL?param=value' -d 'param=value2'
# the dev filters $_GET['param']
# but $_REQUEST['param'] will be 'value2'
# so, if dev developer uses it => a logic flaw
```

* it's possible that a developer is using a GET form, then a POST form. In such a scenario, the developer may use `$_REQUEST` to fetch values. If the dev checked the data at step1, but not at step 2, we may be able to bypass the check in step 1.

```bash
$ curl 'URL/step1?param=value'
# the dev checks the value for param
# if ok, we can go to step2
# now, the dev may "trust" param to be valid
$ curl 'URL/step2?param=verified' -d 'param2=value2&param=value3'
# now, the dev filter $_POST['param2']
# but, we override param value, so
# $_REQUEST['param'] is 'value3' which hasn't been filtered
# if the dev uses it => a logic flaw
```
