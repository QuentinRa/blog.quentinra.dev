As a reminder, you can learn more about wordlists [here](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/general/index.md#-wordlists-).

> CTF are usually using `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` for passwords, and a manually created list of usernames (if needed).

## Brute force authentication forms using Hydra

[See hydra for more information](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/services/bruteforce.md#hydra)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Hydra is mostly used to brute force services, but it can also be used with authentication forms.

```bash
$ hydra -l toto -P wordlist URL http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V
```

<p class="mt-3">The request that we will brute force is something like this</p>

```text
username=toto&password=xxx
```
</div><div>

This command will

* Attack the form located at `URL/login.php` <small>(the `/login.php`)</small>
* Set the field with the name "username" with "toto"
* Set the field with the name "password" with every entry in the wordlist, one by one
* Consider as failures (`-F`) any web page that returns the word "incorrect"

You should check the [brute force services](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/services/bruteforce.md) page to learn more about Hydra.
