# Methodology to exploit webservers

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

🌟  **Find usernames/emails** [See Brute force forms](forms/index.md)

You could achieve this using the website API if there is one, and/or its interface, such as register forms: "this username is already taken", or the same process for emails with the password forgot page...

## 🎣 Tools🎣

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* [nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) (6.2k ⭐). Scan web server for known vulnerabilities.

```bash
$ nikto -h URL
# Server
# SSL certificate
# Headers
```

* Spoof User-Agent

You can install an extension to make the target website believe that you are using another browser. Look for **User-Agent Switcher** extensions on Google. You can try them on [whatismybrowser](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/).

* Use a proxy

You may use a proxy as an intermediary for your requests. If you do, then you can use the **FoxyProxy extension** of your browser to easily swap between no proxy, and your proxies configurations.

* Disable scripts

You may do that to bypass JavaScript verifications. You can use plugins such as [noscript](https://noscript.net/), or ublock by clicking on the following icon

* [wappalyzer](https://github.com/wappalyzer/wappalyzer) (7.8k ⭐) to find frameworks, their versions... It can also be installed as a browser extension or used via their [website](https://www.wappalyzer.com/). If you are using the extension, you might want to uncheck the option to send anonymous data to their website.

## Mitigations

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-4"><div>

* 🔒 Display generic error messages, disable errors messages, and do not give much information <small>(ex: on invalid login, display the message 'credentials invalid', instead of 'username invalid' or 'password invalid')</small>

* 🚧 Test your endpoints with invalid values: 0, -1, characters, symbols... Test your pages with/without excepted parameters, especially if a hacker tries to access pages in an unexpected order.
</div><div>

* 🔫 Do not trust anything coming from the user, its browser, or even your database. Basically, Zero Trust.
