[As defined by the HTTP protocol](/_it/networking/protocols/index.md#-http---80-tcp), HTTP requests encapsulate headers, with can be used by both the client and the server to exchange information. Vulnerabilities related to headers could lead to

* Version Exposure (see below)
* Injections
    * XSS (see [XSS](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/web/forms/xss.md))
    * SSRF (see [SSRF](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/web/forms/ssrf.md))
    * Command-injection (see [RCE](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/web/forms/command_injection.md))
    * File inclusion (see [File/Path exploits](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/web/forms/file_path_exploits.md#file-inclusion))
* CSRF

You can use websites to check your webserver configuration üöÄ

* [observatory.mozilla.org](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)
* [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/)
* [secure-headers-test](https://geekflare.com/tools/secure-headers-test)

The OWASP foundation has a [Secure Headers Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/) with [their recommended top practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-bestpractices).

These issues may have to be fixed on the server level too. If a website does not use automatic routing, then if a hacker uses an invalid URL, they will still receive headers in the response, and these might disclose the server version...

## üí™ Grab HTTP headers üí™

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

* [whatweb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb) (4.2k ‚≠ê). Web scanner.

```bash
$ whatweb URL
# Server
# Libraries used (ex: JQuery...)
# Uncommon Headers
```
</div><div>

`curl` is also a nice way of fetching headers

```bash
$ curl -I IP:port
# all headers
```
</div></div>

There is also [httpstatus](https://httpstatus.io/) for a batch or URLs, or to support automatic redirection.

## üçæ Other tools for fancy folks üçæ

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

You can use [nmap](/_cybersecurity/discovery/nmap/index.md)

```bash
$ nmap --script=http-server-header.nse IP -p80,443
$ nmap -sC IP -p80,443 # may provide less information
```

You can use [Metasploit](/_cybersecurity/exploitation/general/metasploit/msfconsole.md)

```bash
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version
```

You can use your browser, see the network tab of the dev console.

You could use [telnet](/_it/networking/protocols/index.md#-telnet---23-tcp) too, but I doubt you would want to write requests manually... And, it will only work with HTTP, not HTTPS.
