Cookies are used by a server to store data inside a client's browser.

* The server first sends instructions to create cookies
* This is done using the header `Set-Cookie` (one per cookie)
* The client will transfer back cookies in every request to the server

Cookies can be used

* 📦 to store data in the client browser
  * Ex: language
  * Ex: the mode (dark/light)
  * Ex: the name of the user logged (mostly in CTF)
  * Ex: sometimes you will see credentials too in CTF...
  * ...
* 👑 store a session id

> Cookies are usually encoded, mostly in base64. See [encoding](/_cybersecurity/random/encoding/index.md).

**Sessions cookies**

Session cookies are used to store data on the server, associated with someone visiting the website. Once the session is started server-side, a file will be created on the server with an id such as `f71dbe52628a3f83a77ab494817525c6`. The programmer can store inside stuff like

* is the user connected?
* the user information such as the clientID...
* ...

A session is available on every page server-side, so programmers use it to adapt the page according to what we know about the user <small>(ex: not logged in $\to$ redirect to the login page)</small>. 

The server will send the session id in a cookie, and the client will send it back in every request (like a normal cookie), so that the session manager will load the right session file on the server.
