# 📃 Wordlists 📃

<div class="row row-cols-md-2 mt-3"><div>

There are two packages that are providing a lot of wordlists. Install, then use either command `wordlists` or `seclists` to move to the location where the wordlists are stored, and get the path of every wordlist.

> **CTF are usually using `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`** when there is a password to crack. If it's not inside, then it's likely that you're not supposed to use brute force.

### ➡️ Improving efficiency

As a "hacker", if there is a policy of "at least n characters/up to $m$ characters", then it would be very wise to filter shorter/longer values from your wordlists. For instance, with `rockyou.txt`

* `{n}`: only keep values having exactly $n$ characters
* `{n,}`: only keep values having more ($\ge$) than $n$ characters
* `{n,m}`: only keep values having between $[n,m]$ characters
* `{,m}`: only keep values having less ($\le$) than $m$ characters

```bash
# only keep 4 letters passwords
$ egrep '^.{4}$' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > /tmp/4rock.lst
# which is the same as
$ grep '^....$' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > /tmp/4rock.lst
```

As a reminder, you can also merge wordlists

```bash
$ cat wordlist1 wordlist2 wordlist3 > wordlist123
```

### ➡️ generate simple wordlists

There may be a case in which you want a wordlist such as numbers from 0 to 99, or every letter from A to Z. In both cases, I'm using [bash braces expansion](/operating-systems/linux/bash/index.md#braces-expansion) to generate the wordlist like this

```bash
$ echo {A..Z} | tr ' ' '\n' > AZ.lst
$ echo {0..99} | tr ' ' '\n' > 0_to_99.lst
$ echo user{0..9} | tr ' ' '\n' > user_0_to_99.lst
$ echo {admin,adm,user} | tr ' ' '\n' > simple_list.lst
```
