## Recon using certificates/DNS records

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[DNS](/_it/networking/general/index.md#domain-name-system-dns-protocol) are storing records about a domain, and its subdomains, used to translate a domain name to an IP address.

➡️ You can dig into DNS records

* [dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) to fetch DNS records

➡️ You can dig into certificates issued for a domain

* [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) to search for certificates
* [ct search](https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui) same, can fetch old certificates

➡️ You can use scripts

[Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) (7.7k ⭐) is a Python script to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT.

There is also [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) (7.6k ⭐) which is a Python script too.
