## Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

Open-source intelligence (**OSINT**) is any information that you gather from public sources. The OSINT framework, available on [osintframework.com](https://osintframework.com/), is a well-known collection of websites that you can use. Simply expand a node, and you will see websites that can provide you with information about what you are looking for.

## Recon using certificates/DNS records

<div class="row row-cols-md-2"><div>

[DNS](/_it/networking/general/index.md#domain-name-system-dns-protocol) are storing records about a domain, and its subdomains, used to translate a domain name to an IP address.

‚û°Ô∏è You can dig into DNS records

* [dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) to fetch DNS records

‚û°Ô∏è You can dig into certificates issued for a domain

* [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) to search for certificates
* [ct search](https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui) same, can fetch old certificates

‚û°Ô∏è You can use scripts

[Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) (7.7k ‚≠ê) is a Python script to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT.

There is also [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) (7.6k ‚≠ê) which is a Python script too.
</div><div>

‚û°Ô∏è You can use [whois](https://www.whois.com/whois/) website, or their command, to dig for information about the owner of a domain name, their registrar...

‚û°Ô∏è You can use the commands [nslookup/dig](/operating-systems/networking/commands/linux/linux.md#interact-with-the-outside) to query DNS servers.

```bash
# A = IPV4, AAAA=IPV6, MX, TXT, CNAME...
$ nslookup -type=A example.com
$ dig example.com -t A
# ask 1.1.1.1 DNS server
$ nslookup -type=A example.com 1.1.1.1
$ dig example.com -t A @1.1.1.1
```

‚û°Ô∏è You can also use your Google Dorking skills to find subdomains

```text
-site:example.com site:*.example.com
```
