MVC

# MVC in PHP

The MVC is an architectural pattern, in which you are splitting your code into

* **View**: what you will show to the user
* **Model**: the data of your application, usually the SQL-related classes/files
* **Controller**: classes that will fetch some data from the model and render the view

For instance, you could have a view for the head, one for the footer, and one view for the main content of each page. When you want to GET a page, the controller will write the head, get some data from the database (if needed), pass it to the view for the main content, and then write the footer.
