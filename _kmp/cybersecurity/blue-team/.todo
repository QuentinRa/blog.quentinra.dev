Bluetooth
=> eavesdropping
=> unauthorized access
=> malware and viruses to be transmitted

===> BlueBorne (attackers take control of devices without user interaction)
===> Bluejacking to send unsolicited messages or spam to the device
===> Bluesnarfing to access data stored on the device
===> Bluetooth device spoofing attack
)) avoid pairing with unknown/untrusted devices
)) turn off bluetooth
)) up-to-date
++ bluetooth scanning tool to identify vulnerable devices do not require pairing

Wi-Fi
=> eavesdropping (intercept wireless network traffic and analyzing it for sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords)
=> deauthentication (send deauthentication packets to wireless clients, causing them to disconnect from the wireless network)
=> jamming (flood the wireless network with interference, causing it to become unusable)
