# Degree matrix

[Go back](..#advanced-terminology)

The degree matrix or ``matrice des degr√©s`` is a diagonal matrix of the degree of each vertex. For instance if $d(A)=4$ then $a_{A,A} = 4$.

It used, according to Wikipedia, with the adjacency matrix to make the Laplacian matrix (`matrice de Laplace`). It looks interesting since that looks like what we are learning in the optimization course, but I have yet to learn more about it.
