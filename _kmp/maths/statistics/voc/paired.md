# Paired data

[Go back](..)

What we call **paired**-data (`données appariés`), is when you have two samples about the same individuals. For instance, you observed the same individuals in winter and  summer.

That's something important to notice, since the property of **independence** (i.i.d.) is not valid here, so most of our usual tests won't work on this dataset.
